2017-01-17 21:14:59,"Charlotte, NC",N. M.,1.0,This is the absolute worst company to ever get a private student loan with. They don't even deserve one star. I have been receiving multiple calls every day and two months later they still have not handled the issue. They say a form has not been received when I confirmed twice with the account manager that the deferment letter was received. They are only after money and have no concern for students or graduates. I'm literally in tears of frustration. Please don't choose Sallie Mae.
2017-01-03 16:46:44,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",Joe,1.0,I had student loan with CitiBank. I moved to new location and reported my new address to Citibank. At the same time my student loan was purchase by Sallie Mae. I did not receive any mails from Sallie Mae. Few months had passed and I called Sallie Mae after finding out that Sallie Mae purchase my loan. I had late payments. I tried to explain my situation but they did not care. I paid my loan fully. Then when I was trying to purchase a house the late payments were on my record. I called Sallie Mae and explained my situation and told them to take out late payments from my record. They refused and I couldn't purchase a house. Don't get loan from Sallie Mae. They DO NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS.
2016-12-12 17:16:40,"Canton, OH",Meaghan,1.0,"I've had quite a few less than impressive encounters with Sallie Mae student loans. However, once I started the automatic payment plan everything was fine for a few months... Then I switched banks. I changed my bank information on the site, paid my loan manually for that month, and signed up for automatic payments through the new bank. There have been multiple issues. Including starting the automatic payments and then suddenly not making them. Causing late fees and my credit to go bad. So I paid manually and then they randomly would withdraw automatically certain months. I've had to call my bank and put a hold on them twice. They've attempted to withdraw from my closed bank account even though I've deleted it from the site, and it just reappears. Now I'm attempting to make payments and it won't go through at all. I've called my bank and ensured it's not on their end. It's beyond the point of ridiculous."
2016-11-08 23:55:28,"Knoxville, TN",K. L.,1.0,"I signed (and aunt cosigned) for a $10,000 loan with Sallie Mae in 2013. They informed me that I wouldn't owe them a penny until 6 months after I graduated. However, 1month (this was October, I started school in September) into school they started harassing me telling me that I owed them money. I asked them how when I just started school!? I told the agent that I had been promised by multiple Sallie Mae agents that I wouldn't owe until 6 months after I graduated (before and after I signed). The person I spoke with said they didn't know but I owed them and if I didn't pay they would take action against me and my cosigner. So of course, as a scared 18 year old I payed up. I had just gotten a minimum wage paying, part time job to pay my phone bill, etc, so I fortunately had the $75 they were asking for. However, it didn't stop there. I continued to keep calling (and getting transferred hundreds of times) asking how my account could already be in default as I had literally just gotten the loan, still no answer. I literally spent hours on the phone trying to speak to these people, someone, anyone who could tell me about my account and where my money was going! It is my right to know what is going on with my account, but all the agents were acting like it was a big secret or something, which it indeed turned out to be. My cosigner started calling me asking why it was in default and that it was affecting her credit so she would sue me if I didn't pay. I literally didn't have anything except a part time job, a cell phone, and a car that was given to me from a family member. Finally, months after calling numerous times and speaking with countless people, I got an answer from a sallie mae agent and she informed me that what I was actually paying this whole time (from the 1month (October) after starting school in Sept, 2013) was the interest on the loan, not the actual loan, and that I owed them over $5000 in interest. Shocked, I asked if there was anything I could do because I was a struggling student and barely even surviving as it is, and I was told no the only option I had was to pay it. I even told her that I had been scammed by them and she didn't have any answer so I kept getting transferred, still with no answers. I struggled for months until eventually I had to drop out of school to look for work full time just to pay the loan because they were harassing me daily! Almost immediately (1 month after quitting school) they started calling again saying now I owed nearly $400, instead of the $75 I had been paying, I was floored. Again I asked how is this possible and no one would give me an answer, everyone I spoke to said I have to pay or they would take action against me!! Still to this day, three years later and being in contact with them constantly, no one from Sallie mae has contacted me or tried to resolve this issue with me. The only calls I ever get from them is a recording saying I owe them money! I still tried to pay them despite them lying to me plus my hardships and they wouldn't work with me at all! All they have ever offered is to give me a deferment for $50 (claiming that it goes towards interest), which I have done. I don't know what to do, but I have filed a complaint with the BBB, and now here. Still no call from Sallie Mae or offer to help from any agents thus far. THIS COMPANY IS COMMITTING HUGE FRAUD AND SCAMS ON CLIENTS WHO HAVE TAKEN LOANS WITH THEM! I have seen online they had been sued in 2014 for fraud against clients and they agreed upon a settlement. However, what about the rest of us who have been scammed by Sallie Mae and have gotten no settlement check, let alone any answers!? What are we supposed to do next? So far, I have just been paying them but I feel this is so wrong and I definitely have been scammed and treated unfairly! Seems like this is extremely common amongst the people who have, unfortunately, taken out loans with sallie mae, in one form or another. Thanks in advance."
2016-10-30 21:13:14,"San Jose, CA",M. A.,1.0,"I have a student loan in Sallie Mae, and as soon as 6 months hit after I graduate from school my payment became from $45 to $495. I have not taken the nursing exam yet so I have no money to pay for that very high amount and my parents couldn't help me because they are struggling with financial too. So I called them to do a deferment at least 3 months till I pass my exam and get the job I went to school for, and so the struggle started. First, every time I call them they keep transferring me back to automated machine or transfer me to a person, and hangs up once I addressed the reason why I called. I have called them a hundred times and they kept doing it. 2nd, when I finally get to talk to a person that didn't hung up on me, so I told her that I needed to defer my loan for at least 3 months, and she told me that she wouldn't help me unless I pay the amount due on that month. So I paid them $495 (I had to borrow money from a friend because I don't have that much amount). And again, when I tried to call them for a deferment, they did it again. Every time I call them they keep transferring me to answering machine or they hang up on me. After more than 20 calls, I finally talked to someone and she were to help me. Before we went over to processing the deferment, I asked the lady to do cancel my automatic payment that I had made for September 2016 and October 2016, and she told me that she was able to cancel that. While we were processing my deferment, I have to pay $150 for a deferment fee so they can process it, the lady said that it would take 3-5 business days for the result and they will be sending a mail and an email for the result, BUT THEY DIDN'T. I only found out that my loan were finally on deferment on my account online. It says ""On deferment till Jan. 6, 2017."" So a month passed. When I checked my account summary on my bank I saw that it was negative $400. When I went over to my statement it showed that Sallie Mae had charged me $485 on October 28, 2017 while I am on deferment. I thought the lady on Customer Service had cancel my automatic payment, it turned out she didn't!!! I almost fell out of my chair after I saw may bank account with NEGATIVE $400!!! This is so irresponsible of them!!! That is why I did a deferment for 3 months because I don't have money to pay for it until I pass my exam and get a job. Plus I paid Sallie Mae $150 for the deferment!!! This is so frustrating!!!"
2016-10-29 03:33:41,"Germantown, MD",Avonlea,2.0,"I haven't really had too much of a problem with Sallie Mae since taking loans out with them in 2013. The one thing I can't stand about them is the annoying amount of phone calls when your payments are due. My loan has been in deferment since I started my master's degree, so I have not been making payments. My mom was co-signer and my statements go to my parents address so I don't always get them on time. Apparently I missed two months of payments, and within a week (Oct 25-Oct 28) they have called me 19 times!!I ignored the first two calls because it was from a number I did not recognize, and I figured if it was important whoever was calling would leave a voicemail. Well Sallie Mae does not leave voicemails apparently, and on the fourth call I picked up the phone to a recording telling me to call them back for information about my account. It wasn't even an actual person and there was no information about what was going on with my account. I understand giving someone a reminder call to let them know that payments are due, but 19 calls in the span of four days is harassment, especially since I was making payments on time before my loans went into deferment."
2016-10-25 21:57:07,"Milwaukee, WI",Tony,1.0,"So I took a loan out from Sallie Mae to cover a year for college. Worst mistake of my life. I got my grandfather to co-sign the loan for me and they immediately accepted us. Well I first signed up for auto bill pay and that was mistake number one. They input all of my information wrong. Got my first late letter in the mail but that was after they bombarded my family with phone calls and letters. Manually paid the first month. I call them up again to try and resolve the issue so they can just take it out of my paycheck every month. Wrong again. They did not accept that payment method either. So I finally manually set up all of my information online hoping that this will work. Everything seemed to be on the up and up until one day a rep called my father saying my information was deleted and they needed to ""update"" my information. Fast forward to my senior year of college, I get a text from my father saying Sallie Mae tried calling my aunt to get in touch with me. Well I was immediately confused as to why they wouldn't have called me. I get on the phone with my rep and am immediately transferred back and forth to different departments. Turns out MY PAYMENTS WEREN'T ACCEPTED FOR OVER 120 DAYS!!! They told me there was a problem on their end that they didn't catch! That if I didn't make a minimum payment my loans were going to have to be paid in full!! I immediately said if my loan payments were not being accepted then why wasn't I told? The rep immediately transferred me to a supervisor after being on hold for 45 minutes! I am several days away from accepting my degree early and in the process of finding a job! These people are scam artists and completely unhelpful!!!"
2016-10-20 17:56:14,"Kansas City, MO",Colbi,1.0,"I currently have student loans with Sallie Mae. I graduated in 2015 and have started paying off my large amount of loans (PS: Private schools are expensive) I have. As a recent graduate I have had difficulty finding a full time job that pays me enough to make my payments. Luckily I have wonderful parents who help me out. My complaint is the obsessive amount of phone calls I receive from Sallie Mae regarding my account and payment that is due. Over this past week, Oct. 17-20, I have been called 17 times!! Some as early as 8 a.m. and other as late at 10 p.m.! I understand I have a payment due, but calling me every other hour is not going to make me pay it any faster. I am aware of my payment when I get an email about it a week or two in advance. You DO NOT need to call me everyday, multiple times a day to remind me.It is the most annoying thing and I can honestly say that if you call me once and LEAVE A VOICEMAIL instead of not leaving one and calling me every hour on the hour, I will be more likely to call back or make my payment. I have learned to ignore the calls and go about my day, but at some point it is a little out of control. I know this won't stop the calls but I hope they understand this is outrageous. I will make my payment for goodness sake! Stop badgering me!"
2016-09-23 00:23:15,"Romeoville, IL",Ronald,1.0,"I went to Westwood College online, a few years ago, Paying on a 14,000 dollar loan, thru Sallie Mae, and the Dept. of Education. 7000 for each loan. Am I crazy or no. The thing is I only went for 5 and a half months and dropped out. Can't believe I owe 14,000 for 5 and a half months, and I have been paying for years, maybe 3. Now Sallie Mae is saying I missed a payment, which I haven't. Now the harassing phone goes day and night, and stupid me they asked where I work. Now I'm sure I will get harass now at my work. Can you help, or guide me in the right direction."
2016-09-08 07:58:19,"Elgin, SC",A. W.,1.0,"My experience with Sallie Mae has been horrible. My daughter had a loan with them for school in which I am a cosigner on the loan. I got sick and my daughter had to put school on hold for awhile to help me out. Before I could completely recover, the harassment started and has not let up. They call us constantly and even at my work place in which I explained that I'm not allowed to get personal calls and asked them to stop before they get me terminated. They do not care. If I get terminated I explained they won't get anything. My daughter cannot afford to pay them a lump sum of money and the payment they are trying to bully out of us neither of us can pay due to my still trying to recover from being sick, yet they do not care. They harassed her to tears and commenced to tell her what she should do to get the money. These people act as if they do not understand the plight that everyone is not rich and if they were they wouldn't apply for their loan. Please do not make the mistake of acquiring a loan from them because it will be the worst thing you've ever done. You'll never get any peace. I hate my daughter ever got a loan with them because they do not care about the consumer at all and it's obvious they do care if you go through personal issues and cannot make the full payment they want. They don't even try and work with you. Just tell you what you can do. I plan on going to school myself soon in the future, but I assure you if I need a loan I will sooner pull out my own teeth than deal with this company ever again! Again, this company is a nightmare."
2016-08-30 02:51:48,"North Tonawanda, NY",Taylor,1.0,"Where to begin with this company, they've been a nightmare from the beginning and they never seem to get better! I fell for the low monthly payment of $25 and then got slammed with a much higher payment right around Christmas. When I called to see if they could help I was rudely told I could either default on the loan or go back to school and defer it... Yeah, not helpful. That was several years ago and I'm still paying on that loan, which they told me I'd have paid off in October, but somehow my payments don't seem to add up and my interest rate got raised and I've been paying more than they ask each month on time.Then there was a matter of the loan that was under my mom's name, my sister's social security number, my school, and some random loan amount neither of us had chosen. When we called to ask about it and see whose it really was, if it was anyone's at all since it was so messed up, we of course didn't get any help and were pretty much told that we would just have to pay it.Then there was the mystery loan that popped up 3 years after I had graduated. We have been paying on multiple loans and one day we get a letter from the department of education about a loan that was in default for 3 YEARS! Once again we called Sallie Mae and they had the nerve to say they tried contacting us about it but we never made payments... because yeah, we wanted to pay every loan except that one! Not to mention the fact that they had our house phone, my cell phone and email address, and our physical address. Pretty sure if they tried to get a hold of us like they said they would have done it. They had multiple opportunities to contact us.I absolutely DO NOT recommend this company to anyone for any reason. They've been nothing but horrible and useless for about 8 years and I can't wait to be done with them (whenever that day is going to be). I don't feel comfortable giving them one star, they deserve 0, and even that wouldn't reflect how awful they are. Avoid this company like the plague they are."
2016-08-29 20:46:38,"Marietta, GA",Eve,1.0,"Sallie Mae is doing so horribly they had to change their name to NAVIENT. They're still horrible. I've had multiple issues with them and their customer service is so rude. Here's some examples of their rudeness: I'd taken care of a bill the day before. The day after, Sallie Mae calls. I say ""Oh I've already gotten that taken care of."" He says ""Well obviously it hasn't been taken care of otherwise we wouldn't be calling now would we?"" Guy calls and tries to keep me on the phone. I tell him I'm out and would like to wait until I'm home to look at the computer and my accounts. He keeps me on, saying ""Oh well we can just do a post-dated check or a card"" and I say ""I'd much rather do it when I'm at the computer so I can make sure everything's straight"" and he tries his best to keep me on the phone. Finally he says ""Yeah what's the REAL reason you can't pay today?"" I didn't say I COULDN'T PAY! I just said I wanted to make sure my accounts were in order before I start doing post dated checks!He just called again today and I said I had to call him back. He said ""Well you said you'd call back Friday and you never did!"" Actually I did and it went straight to a machine. So he kept saying ""So I'm gonna call back and you better answer! You're gonna answer right? You better answer!"" They just make everything so uncomfortable and aren't nice at all!"
2016-08-26 22:50:07,"Mohnton, PA",eric,1.0,"My son took student loans to finish his college. He graduated in 2014. He has met EVERY requirement of the ""remove co-signer application"" available on their website. His credit score is north of 775. No loans other than the student loans...and the denied it, saying loan to debt ratio was too high??? I contacted my state representative, and NBC Responds, the television station seeks to help people with problems that they can't seem to resolve. Neither got far. The BIG BANK is boss, and with 43% of people in default on student loans, they will do anything to hold onto co-signors...it is wrong. Just be frickin honest, and put on your website, you will not be able to remove co-signer unless they die or loan is paid off. YOU SUCK SALLIE MAE!!!"
2016-08-18 17:53:56,"Phelps, NY",Kent,1.0,"My son borrowed money and I was the co-signer. I can not even make up how bad the customer service is. Once he graduated and started to work his student loans went up from 25.00 a month to 540.00 a month. We called and got them dropped to 205 a month. The process was set up with Sallie Mae and by Sallie Mae. It took 6 one-hour long or more phone calls to get it straight. Phone calls so bad that I do not understand how a organization ran like this could be in business. One call I was transferred 8 times, the record is 10. There is so many hidden items in the loan contract and the way they conduct business is worst. Please parents and students, find other funding."
2016-08-08 20:03:19,"Claremont, CA",Thomas,2.0,"So my parents co-signed on a $10,000 loan for me. My parents live in a different state than I do. Now, if I am like three days late with my payment here's what happens: My dad texts me, ""Sallie Mae is calling multiple times per day on your loan."" I start getting automated calls from them a couple hours later (outside business hours so I can't call back right away). I call them the next day, make a payment and ask them to stop calling my parents when this happens. The calls continue for two more days, and it starts over the next time I'm a couple days late. I concede they have the legal right to call my parents, but I thought that would be if there were indications that I would default; not that I was a couple days late. And why they would call my parents before they call me is beyond comprehension."
2016-08-02 17:23:57,"Ladson, SC",Belinda,3.0,"In 2002 I went to college and graduated early in 2004. One of my loans was with Sallie Mae and I borrowed $14,000 for school. Today is 2016. Yes 12 years later guess what my loan balance is - a whopping $17400.00 and we make monthly payments. Now I took math in school and for some reason our payments do not touch the principal. It just adds up. And we have paid $275.00 monthly. You figure it out... and more to pay... not sure how this is possible. But it is. We continue to pay due to credit, we would be ruined if we did not pay this... a life time of sorrow."
2016-07-25 05:05:55,"Germantown, MD",marilyn,1.0,"I co-signed for a loan for my son who is out of school but has no job. The deferment period is over and Sallie Mae whets their money. I am a single parent, have school loans of my own. A few payments missed, they called me, I paid at least half and asked if any information was sent that can have a negative effect on my credit report. I was told no. Today I found out that they lied to me. My score is down 80 POINTS!!! EVERYONE KNOWS HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO BUILD A GOOD CREDIT SCORE!! I have heard horror stories about Sallie Mae but I am now having my own experience!!! It sucks to be between the realm of 'rich' and 'poor'. You do not qualify for assistance and you do not make enough to pay your own way so you have to resort to the likes of Sallie Mae!!!"
2016-07-20 19:19:11,"Crockett, VA",Donna,1.0,"I wish with all of my heart that I had never heard of Sallie Mae and never helped my child apply for a loan and co-signed these stupid loans. We could not get any loans anywhere else even with good credit. We are out of deferments with Sallie Mae. My child don't have a job right now. She is trying to find something. I don't understand what is going to happen. She has tried to make some kind of payment each month, but can't make their high payments. We have called and talked to Sallie Mae almost every month and never get straight answers. I couldn't make payments all the time when she was in school, and I am unable to help much now with my husband unable to work due to being injured at work. Am I going to lose everything I own over this? I am worried sick but don't know what to do and can't find anyone to help me. I found this site this time. Is there anyone out there that can at least direct me where to go for help?"
2016-07-17 22:27:13,"Mays Landing, NJ",jim,1.0,"I wish I had read these reviews prior to falling prey to this Legal Loan Shark of a company. I, like the rest of us that want to further the education of our children, had to pay for everything - no grants, no nothing. However, I been paying all four loans while my son was in school from the start, 4 years of it, that was over $1,000 a month every month for 4 years. Then he graduated, Whoopie. Can't find a job. I send each payment (2) separate accounts, two separate bill pay checks sent. I send extra. I get told that I am behind. I asked, ""How could that be, I send more than the minimum required amounts each month."" Ready for this explanation. After my 7th call to these ignorant turds, hung up on, or ""I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.""  The one lady tells me that the reason for the confusion is the fact that the Finance Department does not know where to apply the extra money so it goes towards 'rears'. What 'rears'? I'm sure she meant 'Arrears'. I said that makes no sense at all. It should automatically go towards the principal. So then I get told that the payments are based on being ahead by one month. I mean really? What is wrong with this outfit, no manners at all, they got me so pissed off. I went as far as yelling that had my son been a immigrant, he would have had a full ride, but because he is an American, he gets nothing, and yet they base all his financial documents based on my salary and my wives. Why? He is over 18. This Sallie Mae corporation is nothing more than a legal Loan shark that sucks the life out of every person that falls for their ""Loans"". Once they get you to sign on the dotted line, they got you and if I worked at this Pyramid Ponzi scam ** hole and spoke to the customers the way they do, I would have been fired. No wonder education is not within the reach of any American here. I hope Trump plucks your feathers and expose you for what you really are. Out for yourselves."
2016-07-05 15:35:17,"Chicopee, MA",David,1.0,"Sallie Mae is the worst loan company I have worked with, and I will regret my decision until the day I die. Sallie Mae promises new loan buyers the world, but once you sign the papers, their well-wishes become fangs filled with venom. When I first applied for a Sallie Mae loan, I was hooked by their low-interest rate (which, compared to the other loan providers, 6% was great). After signing the dotted line, that 6% became 9%. When I argued it, the customer service reps would either sit there in silence, laugh or just hang up on me.Another issue is that they are not willing to work with you, at all / no matter what (especially post the forbearance stage). They want me to pay 797.13 a month on top of another loan that is from a different company... I can afford 1/2 of that, easily. BUT, rather than getting something instead of nothing, they declined every solution I had and just hung up on me. I begged and pleaded, but they would rather have my co-signer and I go into default than to work with me.The customer service portion is a joke. One rep called me a liar when I told him I am borrowing money to pay my loans (really??). Another rep laughed at me when I told her of my issues, and she told me ""Sucks to be you, kid."" and hung up on me. Another rep said ""I have better things to do than work with people like you."" and hung up on me. These are three of the MANY calls I had with them, most of them either equal to worst than what I just said. They really make Comcast customer service look like angels.Finally, I am in a situation where the money I make doesn't compare to the payments required. One rep, laughing while he said it, told me to find another place to buy-out my loans. I may just do that because I'm working myself to death for nothing. I wish the absolute worst to Sallie Mae, and I truly believe in karma. Companies like Sallie Mae are the reason why people are struggling to this day. I made the choice to go to college, I graduated top of my major, I work harder now than I ever did to survive. What goes around, comes around, Sallie Mae.UPDATED ON 07/23/2016:After writing my previous review, I was contacted by Sallie Mae's Office of the Customer Advocate. In their message, they left me a phone number to call. I suddenly felt like my prayers were going to be answered, and that my payments would become more manageable. NOPE. Instead, when I called the number and I was immediately sent to a representative (whom I want to publicly name, because she was a class piece-of-work, BUT if I do, I feel that Sallie Mae will find another way to punish me). The representative introduced herself to me, apologized for my experience, and stated that she was going to listen to all my calls in hopes to fixing the issues that I had. She never once said ""We will try to find a way to help you pay what you can"", instead... just ""fix the issues that I had"". She told me to wait two days, and she would call me back. After waiting those two day, she contacted me. She immediately reminded me that I was being recorded and I must understand this (immediately igniting shivers of rage within me). She promptly followed that she found no proof to the experiences I had, and professionally called me a liar. She stated she only went back to ""2015"", to which I have been having these issues with Sallie Mae reps since 2014 (when I graduated). After telling her what I stated was still the truth, she just replied ""Yup"" and I began to hear an onslaught of ""taptaptap"" in the background (now documenting her behind). Long story short, after going back and forth with her (and hearing an unending onslaught of ""taptaptap"" in the background), I bluntly asked her ""Did Sallie Mae reach out to me to help me out OR did they seriously contact me JUST to clear their customer service's name?"" She evaded the question and told me, instead, that ONCE AGAIN Sallie Mae will not help me lower my current payments. Sallie Mae's reasoning is as follows: Since I am ""paying"" my loans, I am therefore not considered ""in financial difficulty"", even though I frequently call them, begging to lower the monthly payments. Sallie Mae's wants me is purposely not pay my loans (and call them before 15 day past-due date), then have Sallie Mae NOW take both my co-signer's and my financial information, run a financial report, and make a new payment pooling our incomes. When I disagreed with this, saying it was stupid, and said that I didn't want my brother now getting pulled down with me, her actual response was ""Well, he shoulda knew what he was getting into once he signed the papers. That's what a co-signer is for, right? You can't make your payments, then he can. If you didn't want to put him at risk, you should never have used him."" Really? REALLY??What we knew when we agreed to signing up with Sallie Mae is that I was promised that I would end up paying the loans back at LOW INTEREST/PAYMENT (hence why we were brought to Sallie Mae in the first place... their LOW REPAYMENT PRICES), not the factor that I signed a blood document, seeded with lies, so that they would cripple my brother and I should I experience any struggles at a price tag THEY personally decided.In the end, classic horrid customer service being horrid again, combined with ruthless business tactics. If I hit a miracle and I am actually able to pay off this upcoming month's loans, I will immediately start searching for someone to buy out my loans and save me from the hell Sallie Mae has put me through. Everything about this company is a corrupt from the ground up, and do not trust Navient, either. They are run by the same people and same principles of Sallie Mae (this stated from the ACS, StudentLoans.Gov, and NSLDS representatives I talked to on the phone, post that Sallie Mae phone call). To any/all potential Sallie Mae repliers, DON'T BOTHER MESSAGING ME. You will not get a response from me anymore, no matter what you say. I am completely done dealing with you/interacting with you. May this PLEASE be the last experience I ever have to have with them again."
2016-07-03 18:07:00,"Richmond, VA",Tori,1.0,First of all I never used the Sallie Mae loan because my ex-husband between 2009 and 2014 was in the military and I had went to University of Phoenix and Pikes Peak Community College. Sallie Mae charged me for schools that I didn't even go to. I gave them proof that my identity was stolen and they keep sending me more and more bill statements after stating that I never gone to these horrible schools that wasn't even accredited like Remington College or Everest. Don't ever apply there because some students don't even get jobs after they were promised that they would. They have no accreditation and have the highest rate of college dropouts. They pool your information and tell you you owe them even when you did not go. So Sallie Mae is a piece of useless loan that makes you pay when you didn't go and puts it on your credit. However they can go fly a kite because I am NOT PAYING FOR A SCHOOL I NEVER WENT TO and neither should you.
2016-07-01 15:27:50,"Reading, MA",Carol,1.0,"While my son was in school, he was paying $200 a month toward his loan. Suddenly, they started sending him back a check for $200 a month. We called the phone number provided on the check to find out why. They were to return our call with an answer within 10 days. Nope. Meanwhile, this went on for five months. After speaking to numerous people at numerous numbers that they kept transferring us around to, NOT ONE person could explain why they were sending him $200 every month.Meanwhile, his loan is NOT being paid and interest is accruing yet he is TRYING to pay down his loan. WE assumed it was because since he was in school full-time, he was in ""forbearance"" and they WOULDN'T take his payments! He was paying them from his bank, not through the automatic withdrawal because they wouldn't let him pay the $200 a month that way because he was in school! Since my son has attempted to pay ahead on this loan, they have more than once stopped taking payments and returned payments without any notification to him. I therefore can specifically say that Sallie Mae intentionally causes students to accumulate interest."
2016-06-26 13:56:15,"River Rouge, MI",Julie,1.0,"Sallie Mae is the worst loans for students you say look I have no job. I can't get a job. I have no money. Well you have to pay X amount of dollars for you to get a forbearance and it's 50 per loan. Well if I had that 50 per loan then I wouldn't need this... They don't care what kind of situation you have they want that money... and since you can't file bankruptcy on them they have you... But guess what if you get disabled or draw social security you don't have to pay it is forgiven so what the hell get disab... Then it's all forgiven and then go back to work lol... And the personal loans, signature loans those can be dismissed on bankruptcy so what the hell file easier to start your credit over then get them off your back."
2016-06-04 23:40:39,"Brenham, TX",Alexis,1.0,"I was told, by my financial adviser, that Sallie Mae was the way to go when getting a student loan. It was not. First off, they divided it into 3 separate loans which one was for a ridiculously low amount... that I could've, literally, paid out of pocket... and each had a different interest rate. When it came time to pay, I wasn't allowed to pay more towards one, they divided it up for me and less than half of what I was paying went to the principle balance. A total joke. Customer service was absolutely horrendous and no help at all. I'd get transferred time and time again. Then when I left school, they demanded I pay the remaining amount in full. There was no way I could pay 10 grand out of pocket. They automatically put my loan into default. It took me 6 months to get them to agree to a payment plan. I could go on and on about how awful this company is. If anyone recommends that you go through them, just don't!"
2016-06-01 03:52:58,"Laguna Niguel, CA",farrah,1.0,"I applied to Sallie Mae based off of my college advisor (whom I wish I never listened to) when I was applying for College. I had to open a loan and my advisor kept ""selling"" Sallie Mae to me because ALL her students used it. Since I had less than a week to get my application thru so that I could get approved after I was accepted, I thought, what the heck, why not, seems like a well trusted company.I contacted Sallie Mae and the representative persuaded me to choose a FIXED rate instead of a Variable for my loan. His reasoning was that since I have never opened a loan before, I should choose having a fixed rate. Fine, I did that. Well, my ""fixed"" rate ended up being a wonderful 11.75% rate! There was no going back. I was also convinced by him that this was a GREAT RATE!I graduated 3 years ago. I've been paying on time, every month, well above my minimum monthly payment just to keep my head above water and keep this rate under control. It's been eating me up and I've seriously gone crazy and feel like I'm on the verge of becoming homeless! If I had chosen a variable rate, my interest rate would have been as low as 3 to 6%, not too bad comparing to what I'm stuck with now. And if it was a variable rate, I would have been able to make decent payments instead of these huge chunks that rip right through my bank account.I contacted Sallie Mae to try to negotiate a better rate and they told me that I could either open their credit card and pay off the loan through that (with a rate that will only be 11.50 % instead), or I can have my account go to COLLECTIONS and ruin my credit so that they can work with providing me LOWER rate. Terrible service. I'm almost done paying this nightmare of a loan off.But my advice to anyone thinking of using Sallie Mae is: Do your RESEARCH before opening up any loans with SM. Do not let any representative persuade you into accepting a high interest rate because of the simple reason that you are a student and do not have any loan experience therefore this is why you were approved with a higher rate. Remember: YOU are a STUDENT, you should not have any experiences with opening other loans, hence the reason for why you are opening a student loan. If you do decide to go with SM, make sure you make larger payments to keep your head above water and do not miss any payments!!"
2016-05-14 22:23:58,"Peoria, AZ",Alban,1.0,"The website is horrendous. I spoke with agent some months ago to make sure all of the loans we pay for our kids are automatically withdrawn. I was ASSURED they all were good to go. So I get a notice we are late!!? Of course I go online to pay it. Problem 1: shows the past due loan (at about $84) and it was not on automated system. Ok, not the end of the world so I try to put it on automatic withdrawal (put in bank number routing number, etc.) but it won't take the payment because there is a past due loan (PS past due by 2 days!). OK, I can handle that. I go back and tell the website to make the payment but it's automated. I can't put in an amount and the amount it will let me pay is about $2 less than what it says we owe. No other options so I pay it.Hmmm... website still shows we owe about $84. So I use the phone and run through their system (It's Saturday when most working people can call). So after going through several options (including if you'd like to speak with an agent press #__), I entered the information to make the payment by my bank. The automated response asked me to confirm that I wanted to make a payment of $82 (still an amount lower than they said we owed). I confirmed by hitting the digit 1 on the phone as directed. Then it said we could not make future payments which caught me off guard because they are saying it's past due.As directed I entered 1 again. It recycled back to the same messages that I heard when I first called the number. So I went through the prompts again, but this time the automated response was, ""So, to make sure, you want to pay $164."" So I went through the prompts again, and when it gave the option to speak with an agent, I entered 1 to say yes. It immediately said agent assistance is only available on Monday-Friday (Tell me that up front)! So I hung up and went back online to see what it said on my account now. Nothing had changed. So I called back and went through the prompts again - everything was exactly the same until it got to the ""So, to be sure, you want to make a payment of $228?"" So I just hung up! I can see where this is going - NEVER and I mean NEVER has it been so hard to make a payment on something!!!To add insult to injury, when they left a voicemail about the past due loan, they threatened my credit rating (which is well over 800) over a payment that was only 2 days late. Even then, they had previously told me verbally that all of my loans were on auto-pay. So I haven't even been checking on the amounts due - I just assume it's on auto-pay, which has been working fine for many months.Why when I go on the website am I shown an amount to pay that is LESS THAN what I am being told is PAST DUE. Wouldn't that amount AT LEAST be the amount that is past due??? And then I cannot even change the amount to make it the amount due. If they are worried people will put in a lower amount then fine. But at least let people put in a higher amount especially when it is ""past due.""Do they mean to tell me that they cannot create an online program that would allow me to enter what they are telling me I need to pay? I am no software whiz, but I could even make an Excel sheet that could do that. If their web page could do that they would have their money, and I wouldn't have spent precious weekend time dealing with this.I know this review won't change anything. Student loans are almost a monopoly (""We don't care - we don't have to""). I wrote this review on this website, because although I may have missed seeing it I didn't see anywhere on their website to give feedback. Smart move on their part! I did give them 5 stars of payment options because that issue is good (debit, credit card, or checking account number for direct pull - supposedly), but the service is wretched!"
2016-05-13 15:11:47,"Hicksville, NY",Salesha,1.0,"I applied for 3 loans from Sallie Mae during nursing school using a co-signer. Throughout school, I made monthly payments which were more than the minimum requirement. So much so, my account was almost ALWAYS paid ahead. Sallie Mae even called me and asked if I wanted to ""skip"" a month's payment because I was so far ahead.Fast forward to post graduation. Monthly payments jumped from well below $100 all the way to almost $1000 a month! I have been having a difficult time finding employment, but even so, I find that amount to be absolutely absurd for anyone, much less a new graduate! I have made numerous calls to Sallie Mae for assistance in getting my account into a forbearance. SALLIE MAE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT ANYONE'S SITUATION. They are so incredibly unhelpful and inconsiderate. Yes. I did have a co-signer but that was 4 years ago. Things change and they are unable to assist me anymore. My account was never put into a forbearance and they continue to put my account into collections demanding a balance payment before I can even speak to customer service. They refuse to let me speak to anyone in customer service and continue to tell me the same things over and over again with absolutely no attempt to help resolve my issues.It truly is disgusting that this company is still around. Their debt collections department are like the most disgusting vultures waiting around for the next unfortunate victim so they can attack them until they get their payment. A loyal customer does nothing for them. I have dealt with other loan companies and used to work at a bank and never have I experienced such incredibly appalling customer service or support from a company! After reading all of the other reviews, I do not understand how this company is still allowed to be in business. If I could give them a negative review I would. They don't even deserve the 1 star rating we're forced to give them."
2016-05-04 15:43:59,"Valley Stream, NY",Alda,1.0,"Let me start by stating if a negative number was an option it would apply. I have had nothing but issues with Sallie Mae. This includes the monthly bill received and the people that they have staffing their phones. Currently I am paying the monthly interest on the loan which never adds up. The customer service team has difficulty getting the number to make sense. Since this loan was started I have called every month and never received the same response to my question. It is a joke that these people are in business. If I did not pay the interest my daughter would owe more than twice the amount of the original loan. Sallie Mae is unforgiven if you choose the wrong options for the loan and provide no advice. Just to get rid of them, I will borrow the money from my 401k to pay them off. PLEASE do not take out a loan with them."

Yet I do not qualify for teacher loan forgiveness. My work in a school with 80% poverty isn't honored because of some random legislative date? Why is it that only a borrower who took out his or her first FFELP or Direct loan after October 1, 1998 (or who had no outstanding balance on a prior FFELP or Direct loan at the time the borrower took out a new loan after October 1, 1998), qualifies for forgiveness under this program (My first degree was not in education)?I also do not qualify for government service cancellation because my consolidated loan does not say ""direct"" in front of it! This is a hidden penalty for first generation college graduates like myself that did not have parents or mentors to advise me. Sallie Mae sold me a consolidation loan product ""smart loan consolidation"" after my masters in teaching. It has a 25 year term! I have worked diligently at a ""qualifying school"" (department of Ed. lingo for poor) for 13 years. I have faithfully paid student loans for 25 years and now I have 10 more to go despite the rhetoric our leader has espoused! Disgusted! I should have gone to law school so I could have fought the power that takes advantage of the hard working middle-class public servants who are deceived by corrupt legislators and greedy bankers.

The first was easy and got approved immediately. Past that, it has been nothing but jumping through hoops and them promising that it would not happen again. But, it does. They give the same exact reasons, approve it then have to go through all of it again the next semester. I have one semester left and they refuse to give me a loan, funny thing is that the reason I am getting a degree is to get a job, with that job I can pay back the loan. I don't understand how they don't realize this concept. They are rude EVERY single time I have had to do this. They have hung up on me, told me I have no clue what I am talking about and so on.

Dear Sallie Mae, the public can look it up. Sallie Mae continued to bill him. When called they insisted university said he had not registered for enough hours. However what the representative did not know is that we can see what was submitted. He did register for the required qualifying hours. He had to drop a class as a result and pay cash because he could not afford to pay Sallie Mae and the additional class. Meaning Sallie Mae is now liable for extra costs by him taking longer to complete his degree.Sallie Mae was called multiple times. However the representatives failed to apply the fact that he was registered as a graduate student and not an undergrad so he was not applied hours correctly. The fact that a representative lied twice on the phone was really disappointing. Also, any consumer reading this beware... They will not always apply your electronic submissions and then charge interest on you. So if you submit electronically take a picture of your screen so you can show them the next billing cycle."

I show it being paid in full or really close maybe a payment or two. They say I still owe 7 more years and I have already paid for 16 years on a 8k school loan. They have threatened me numerous times. I am in a forbearance right now trying to get this figured out. I have contacted attorneys that want $250.00 just for me to walk in their door and then another $200.00 to write Sallie Mae a letter.

He applied and was denied when he added a name like mine with clear credit. Sallie Mae didn't care at all if I did or didn't apply. I was threaten several times, police investigator threaten me jail time for lying, and I was forced to retire from service. I'm at war with Sallie Mae collection companies that promise to clear my credit after a payment is made.Remember, you have rights. They are hiding behind the phone as they threaten to take your IRS check, take your job, and they are coming to get your first born. Wrong, first I ask them, ""Send me a validation letter with proof of identity."" That's not going to happen. Well keep calling me then, I'm not paying for loan that I never applied for. If Samuel would be happy to pay for a loan he applied for should be responsible. I'm not going to make any payment because non-compliance from Navient Corp. You have the power to make a difference, send out letters to the three credit bureau with simple explanation of problem. Send out one every month with different date, make copies and file under loan. They will call you ask about the situation. So far the Federal Commission has made an effort to speak to Sallie Mae which now they threaten to confiscate my pension.

Two years later I became a working member of society, and because I had family breathing down my neck about making payments on time, I looked into how to remove co-borrowers. I had to make 12 consecutive on-time payments among a list of many other things. After my 12th on time payment, I submitted my form to remove the co-borrower. To my shock I got a denial letter saying I did not make 12 consecutive on time payments. I spoke with the head supervisor who told me that even though my bill was due on the 17th and I paid early on the 16th, it was a Friday and I paid after 5PM.

I was making payments to the college then one day I found out I was approved for a Sallie Mae loan that I never applied for or applied to. It was a $4000. I defaulted on the loan and now after talking to several people they refuse to settle. Took over $1700 and now that I'm unemployed and disabled they are still unwilling to help. Won't settle unless I pay $3500. I talked to people about student loan forgiveness. Said I qualified for the program and Sallie Mae denied that as well. Worst company ever to deal with!!

I called to see if maybe I can have some sort of relief and hopefully renegotiate my unfair rate, and the rep wouldn't budge and said they only renegotiate rates if my account went to collections.

Now instead of lowering my monthly payments from 600 to say 400, they refused and told me that ""my mother makes enough to pay the bill."" Sallie Mae is expecting me to pay this loan in less than 4 years... That's like taking a loan out for a Ferrari and paying it off in 5 years. IMPOSSIBLE. Sallie Mae will not work with me. They are horrible people to borrow from. I will never recommend Sallie Mae to anyone.

2016-02-01 17:13:52,"San Diego, CA",Karla,1.0,"I borrowed money for tuition at a Rancho School for my troubled teen 10 years ago. The interest is ""only"" 7.5%. The way the interest is calculated daily and added back on I will be dead before this loan is paid off. In early years I was paying double the required amount, have always paid on time and always more than the required amount. Even now it says NO PAYMENT DUE. The interest calculated is usually at least a third of my payment that I make EARLY. I HATE this organization and how they treat people. I do not deserve to be paying 20 years or more on a 20,000 loan that's what appears to be a reasonable interest rate. My Citibank school loan I also had has been paid off long ago. They even had lowered my interest rate when the economy took a dump before 2010. I still owe almost 9,000 and I've been paying for almost 10 years. I keep thinking I can figure out how to make this go down. The only way is to move it to a credit card. It will be paid off faster on a regular credit card at a much higher rate of interest. Every time I look at this thing I want to SCREAM AND CRY. I'm so so ANGRY signing up for a government sponsored loan that I would be treated fairly and with respect and not a usury-type of loan."

2016-01-20 22:17:33,"Denver, CO",Kristina,1.0,"I think there is no question when it comes to Sallie Mae/Navient or whatever new name they come up with to rebrand themselves, it's a nightmare. The loans I took out at 19 are going to haunt me for the rest of my life. They use predatory lending tactics that are inescapable. Coming from a very low-income family, it's difficult to understand the full amount of damage these loans will make. Needless to say, we borrowed money that on paper no other bank would have approved when looking at our income, we then couldn't pay it (surprise). They then kept pushing different forbearance options on us as the loans continued to grow. When we ran out of time on that and tried to negotiate payments nothing was acceptable. They finally offered me payment plan with a 1% interest rate, but I was denied because ""I didn't make enough money"". Hilarious. I don't qualify for a lower payment because I don't make enough money, yet lending me money with outrageous interests rates didn't require a minimum income. Finally I get on this payment plan, was informed it was going to last 12 months then I would have to renew. At 10 months, I called to inquire about my options with in-school deferment. Was told that I had 11 months left on 4 of my loans and 13 months on 1 and that I could use it and then reapply for the payment plan. I called again at 11 months to get more information and be sure to move forward, now my payment plan was extended 3 months because the first 3 months were qualifying and didn't actually get counted towards the payment plan, so I said okay fine. Still inquired about the last of my in-school deferment, was informed it was totally feasible and to submit the paperwork via fax or email. I do this, then get a rejection email saying I can't because I am on a payment plan, I call and speak to someone who informs me they don't know why I received that email because nothing was even processed yet. She then informed me that my best bet was to finish the payment plan out (next 3 months) and then apply for the deferment because then I wouldn't have to wait a year to reapply for the payment program. I said ""oh, well thanks for that great information, I wasn't informed there would be a wait period after. Please void my application and I will do this all in 3 months."" She confirmed my time remaining and it was just as everyone else had said 11 months for 4, 13 months for 1. I log into the site a few days later and see that 3 of my 5 loans are now in a in-school deferment, but it's showing a deferment from April 2015 to February 2016, considering it's January 2016 and I had just started school for the first time in 3 years and have been on a payment plan for the last year, that couldn't be right.I call to clear things up and this rep now informs me that I actually have no more deferment time remaining on these 3 loans, that the months have been used in this last deferment period. I explain my payment plan and that I wasn't in school and have just recently requested a deferment and she insists that I have been on this deferment the last 10 months. I continue to explain to her that is no way in hell the situation and she finally grasps it and puts my account into ""research"". Great. Moving forward, I call about a week later because my automatic payment didn't come out and start talking with a new rep to ensure that I'm not suddenly in an in-school deferment. He tells me I'm not and that I need to set up payments for the next two months. I'm now clearly confused because my last 12 payments came out of my account fine. We talk things out and I tell him about my in-school deferment that I would like to start at the end of the payment plan as security. (I intended to continue making payments, but wanted a cushion in case a tough month come along.) He tells me he would really recommend on stay on the payment plan because it's a great deal, but that when the two months is up I can get the deferment and use my last 11 months. At this point I'm just annoyed with the fact that nobody I talk to ever has the same answer so I follow up again a few days later. This time I'm informed by the rep that my loans are tricky because I can only utilize in-school deferment 4 months after my disbursement date. It's now been ten years so I'm not eligible. I say okay well why did the last 6 reps not explain that also? If that's the case how was I eligible for an in-school deferment 3 years ago which was 7 years since disbursement? He said it must have fallen through the cracks and urges me to apply to extend my payment plan. At this point I'm more frustrated with the inconsistencies and lying that I refuse. I find it hilarious they have no problem calling you multiple times a day when they need you to pay, but nobody can give you the correct answer when it comes to your needs. I dealt with reps yelling at me telling me that I better get another job to pay my loans because it's my responsibility and that I should move home with my parents so I could pay them. (Yes, I should get a 3rd job you are right! I should also move across the country to live with my mother who is staying with a family member, you are right on Navient!)If you are still reading this I'm very sorry, but I will also now share my other frustration. Around this same time that I signed up for my payment plan my 6th loan had been charged off, somehow it was 30 days ahead of the other loans. At this point they were threatening garnishment which I heavily considered because it would have still been far less than what they wanted me to pay but opted for the payment plan. My rep at the time said put $1,000 down and then pay $100/mo, you will get a 0.01% interest rate. I asked if I could receive this in writing, she said they don't send letters because it's charged off and I had 24 hours to decided. I didn't have $1,000 so it didn't seem like an option. She then sends garnishment paperwork to my job (looking back I actually think it was just employment verification, but it scared me enough to panic into settling). My employer agrees to advance me the money and let me pay it back over the next weeks. I pay the 1,000 and the payment plans begins and after 90 days I will receive the 0.01% interest rate. About 7 months later, I am looking at my statement and see that the loan is just growing. I didn't expect it to go down much but I didn't expect it to grow with a practically 0% interest rate. I call and am then told, there is no way they agreed to that, ""the payment you are making is way too small to qualify for that."" I then continue to explain this was really the agreement, the arrogant rep tells me I'm not paying enough and that if I pay $150/mo I would qualify (the $50 difference seemed like BS, but I agreed). Fast forward 4 months and I still didn't see a change in the interest rate, called and this rep was very helpful and fixed it on the spot.All and all, nobody should ever ever ever ever ever borrow from them. There is nothing I regret more in life. I'm also well aware that I borrowed the money and I'm frustrated that at 19 I didn't know better. I'm also frustrated that my loan amount has more than doubled and there is absolutely no way out. This is a corrupt company who lies, cheats, steals and manipulates their customers. Save yourself."

Sent certified letter with copy of the uncashed check and received letters saying ""I had co-signed the loan and was responsible for this amount"".SallieMae/Navient have destroyed my credit.

2016-01-12 02:47:39,"Souderton, PA",Brad,1.0,"The level of incompetence here is nearly impossible to express in words, but I'll try. August of last year, I received a notice from Sallie Mae (SM) that they were discontinuing a relationship with a company that processed their loan payments, and a new remittance address was provided. I called SM to discuss, and the representative suggested setting up an automated ACH payment that would withdraw the loan payment from my bank account each month. It sounded like a good idea, so I provided my bank account info.In September, I received several automated voice mails that my payment for the month was past due. I called SM to discuss and was told that once it's set up ""sometimes it requires an additional month for the automated ACH payment to work."" In the meantime, I should send them a check as I had in the past. I was then assured that the following month the ACH payment would go through.In October, I received several more automated voice mails that my account was past due for the month, so I called SM. I told them to forget about the ACH payments; I would just pay as I had been with a check from my online bank account. In January, I was balancing my checkbook for the year, and discovered 2 automated ACH payments to SM for November &amp; December (in addition to my checks) and realized that double payments had been made. In an attempt to be proactive, I called SM and explained the situation to the representative, and said ""I would like to skip the payments for the next 2 months"". She said it was OK and she would ""turn off"" the automated ACH.This past weekend, I again received several automated voicemails that my account was past due. I called today and explained the situation in detail to the representative. He confirmed that I had called in August to set up the automated ACH and simply said ""I don't know why it didn't work."" He then proceeded to put me on hold for 15 minutes to ""discuss it with my manager."" He then said they had applied the extra payments to the principal amount of the loan and there was nothing they could do about it; I still owed the payment for this month. WTF? If the level of incompetence of this government sponsored agency is typical, we are truly doomed as a nation. As a result of this experience, I called a bank that had offered to consolidate my student loans. Although I'll probably pay a slightly higher interest, it will be worth it for the peace of mind."

Multiple calls and many false promises later the issue still has yet to be resolved. Fees have been accumulating over this time, credit affected, and I cannot re-consolidate because of this. I can't escape because they will not fix their mistake after years of calling them up, spending hours on the phone explaining the situation, finally getting the representative to understand that they made a mistake, promising it will be fixed by a certain date, then nothing. It's a no-win situation. It is just a cycle I've been stuck in for 2 years and I cannot move on with my financial life. I'm frustrated and miserable and Sallie Mae will not help me. In fact, goes out of its way not to. I have no idea how to positively move on from this and I don't know where to find help."
2015-12-17 01:19:29,"Orange, CA",Crystal,1.0,"I took out two private loans with Sallie Mae to go to law school. My payment is now due and they are requiring payment of roughly $600 per month. Mind you, this doesn't include my other loans that I have with another company for undergrad or the other law school I transferred to. Additionally, this loan repayment amount by itself is more than 10% of my gross income at the moment. So today I called Sallie Mae and spoke with a representative named Zachary. I asked him if there was some sort of repayment plan based on my income or what they could possibly do because I want to pay my loans. I just can't afford to pay more than 10% of my gross income to a single loan provider. Sallie Mae's response was this: I could pay $100 to file a forbearance which would only last three months and then leave me in the same situation as I am in currently; or allow my loan to go to collections for Sallie Mae, so that I can work out a different payment plan with their collection department. I find it very concerning that those are my only two options and Sallie Mae refuses to work with me on a different repayment plan."

I made a mistake on my loan application amount &amp; was approved for 3x the amount I needed for the single semester/year. I called &amp; spoke to a rep immediately that told me not to worry, my school would only accept what I needed for the loan and she refused to edit and decrease it for me. I've waited and my school accepted the full amount. I called Sallie Mae back to make edits (since this is out of the school's control) &amp; was told it was too late and the only thing I can do is use the refund I receive and send it back to them...but I will still be charged interest on the full amount. I feel like this is an impossible circle and they act as if they are unable to edit or assist in any way... It's all a scam! I've dealt with loans, I am not new here.

2015-11-07 01:01:55,"Pittsburgh, PA",Max,3.0,"I'm going to tell you the unvarnished truth about my experience with Sallie Mae. I started in community college and transferred into a four year school which only dealt with these ** wads (funny how that works). I didn't have a choice so I had to sell my soul to fraud and usury like the rest of you. When I graduated in 2005, the tab was about 33K and change @ 8.75%. Even in those times I think the principal was a nosebleed. They were also kind enough to split apart the loans into eight or nine separate payments as opposed to one lump loan which if I recall was about $350/mo and in the current inflation I would say is closer to $500 in 2015. I was desperate to consolidate which was the only way to refinance in those times, and I was able to merge four or five of the subsidized ones into a 5.5% note with a company which eventually became XLS and three stayed in the possession of our good friend Sallie still at 8.75%. Then the economy was nuked and my variable interest rates from Sallie dropped to 2.75% which was the juice they tacked when the loans were sold. I never missed a payment from that point on because I think my total payment was something like $60 bucks/mo when the rates fell down from 150, and the XLS fixed loan stayed at 140. When I asked for forbearance at the end of 2007, SM granted it once I faxed them the forms and I got it lifted in early 2008 when I got a better job. Once I got into the job I have now in 2010 I was able to pay down two of the three loans completely by about 2013 and at the end of 2014 was able to refinance the final one and the XLS fixed loans with Citizen's for 2.3% variable (I am betting Fed never raises rates bc of derivatives and if they do we're all boned anyway so ** debt payments). I do hate Sallie Mae still to this day simply because they are bloodsuckers and its owners are in the class of people responsible for most of the nation's problems. However my experiences with them and their staff was prior to 2008, I am guessing things were slightly different then than now. I never had an issue with payments hitting the wrong account or wrong loan when making separate payments. Much like the mafia, you make your payments with the juice and they leave you alone. I realize this experience is not typical, but my advice is to take advantage of refinancing and move at least some of your loans away from SM. All bankers are criminals but Citizen's customer service in general is fairly good (although I have not needed help with the refinanced loan)."
2015-11-05 18:42:45,"Chapmanville, WV",Haleigh,1.0,"I have never see a more incompetent and unprofessional company as Sallie Mae!!! They want me to pay an absurd amount of money a month that is more than I even make a month before taxes and when I call to have my monthly payment lowered they never want to help! And the few times someone did ""help"" I get a call months later to be told that my payments are late and that the program that the other person put me in wasn't even approved or allowed! This has happened on more than one occasion, and the person who calls is always rude and when I tell them I've been paying they say, ""Yes I saw that but what you're paying is wrong!"" I have to mentally prepare myself every time I have to call them because I know when I get off the phone with them I'm going to be in tears because of how rude and unhelpful they are! It's very hard to find a job in my country so for a couple months I was in between jobs and when I told a representative of Sallie Mae that he replied with ""Well what are you supposed to do about next month's payment?"", I was like I don't really know, I can't really help my situation right now. I've only applied to about a hundred places, I can't help if I'm not getting hired anywhere! He was extremely rude and that wasn't all that he said to me, he talked down to me like I was nothing just because I didn't have a job, something that was out of my control! I really wish I had written his name down and filed a complaint against him for talking to me like that! But at the time he just had me so upset I couldn't really think of anything like that! I tell everyone I know to never get a loan through them, I wish I had known how awful of a company they are when I was applying for my loan, I would have never gotten a loan through them! I'm going back to school to get a second degree since my first hasn't really paid off so thankfully I'm going to have a couple of years where they have to leave me alone and defer my payments whether they like it or not!"
2015-10-22 17:51:48,"Charlottesville, VA",Kristen,1.0,"I have a private student loan with Sallie Mae. I had a deferment in place that expired in September. I was told by an associate that I would be contacted to renew my deferment before it expired. I was never contacted until three days ago by an incredibly rude associate who said I was two payments past due and needed to pay $450. Turns out my account was due two days before the call and I was never contacted. I only owed one month ($215) not two and they would not transfer me to anyone who could help extend my deferment. Said until I paid the current month and next month there was nothing. I have a cosigner on my account and they ALWAYS call him harassing him or mail to him but never to me. I wish I had known how sneaky and unprofessional Sallie Mae was before I got a loan from them. They are horrible, unprofessional and threaten and tell lies to get people to pay! Avoid them at all costs!Updated on 03/17/2016: I have an ongoing issue with Sallie Mae in regards to my private student loan. Most recently I spoke with a customer advocate in order to set up an income adjusted loan payment and an issue with customer service reps harassing my co-signer. We went over my income and expenses and my cosigner also spoke with her. She called back to say my payment would be $68 a month for two years and we set up 24 automatic payments. She said she had to forward to financial for review. She called me back the next day and ""suggested"" that we review my numbers I listed for income and expenses because it looked like I had a monthly deficit (which I do and is the reason I was calling for help). She went over each number and greatly encouraged me to change my answers in order to get approved. I work night shifts and she called and woke me up so I was a little fuzzy headed.She said she would call the next day with an answer and it was over the weekend before she called again. She very rudely said that now between me and my cosigner we had a positive balance every month and did not qualify for the income reduction. So my payments would remain and my past due would remain. She also never addressed my customer service complaints from earlier. I feel her actions by calling me back and asking me to change my numbers and causing me to get declined for the reduction are highly unethical. The customer advocate should be just that. She is no customer advocate however a Sallie Mae advocate."

They have harassed my co-signer that is a disabled veteran battling stage 4 cancer. All I tried to do was get my payments down just a little until I found a job, and nothing. I either make too less, or my co-signer makes too much. I recently was accepted to a program on September 21st to bring my payments down to $193 a month if I paid off one of my loans, and I did. All I had to do was call back and set it up, and they said I wasn't qualified for the loan payment I was told I was qualified for! This first started on July 28th where I paid $150 loan forbearance, and two months later, they said I never paid $150 but it is in my bank statement stating I did! So they never gave me the loan forbearance, literally stole money from me, then continued to harass my co-signer who is very ill. Next, I paid $149 to pay off a loan, then they authorized it 2 times in my bank instead of 1 time, which put my bank in the negative leaving me with 5 overdraft fees. (This was the loan I was told to pay off before I can get the $193 monthly payment that I qualified for.) I had my bank fax them 3 times to show it was Sallie Mae that caused the overdraft. They still refused to acknowledge it was. I am a military veteran, and I have never been treated in such a manner in my entire life.

They again have no idea what they are doing but have a good way of reassuring me they have no idea and will ""look in to it"" (until it's lunch and they have to go see their buddies at McDonalds). If I ever ask to speak to their boss they assure me that is not necessary, which it is, and that they can handle my issues, which they don't.

I dropped out one day before Sallie Mae should have been refunded their money but the Dean of students wrote it up as I dropped out 2 days later so that the school could get their money. When I originally applied to the school and sat down with the registrar I was told I had no credit and would not be able to get a loan by myself and would need a co-signer. I told them no one in my family would co-sign and that I knew nothing about the loan process and wasn't comfortable taking on the loan amount by myself. They pushed me to sign anyway and said the Dean of admissions would co-sign for me???Once the scam was leaked on the news about the college the co-signing was part of the scam. When I dropped out I asked for copies of my enrollment forms. They were in the process of going around class by class and forcing students to sign a waiver for the fact they were told they would get a degree when they wouldn't. I went to admissions knowing the office would have few employees and asked an employee I had become close with to grab the copies of my enrollment and loan papers. He did it, but as I was leaving they literally were right on my tail yelling for me to come back. Two days later they had my business teacher call me and beg me to come back. I have the original transcript of the loan with Dean of admissions as the loan cosigner. I don't know how she is dodging this but now I'm 25000.00 in debt.

They would rather have us go into default on our accounts so they can collect more money. I make all my payments on time, every single month. I have taken out a second job to try to make ends meet and Sallie Mae will not help in any way. Sallie Mae needs to offer better support, OR DON'T OFFER THE LOAN MONEY OUT SO EASILY to borrowers. I work hard for my money and it's gone every single pay check with Sallie Mae's high interest rates. Shouldn't there be a reward or incentive for people who pay on time. When I'm unable to pay on time or even pay at all, Sallie Mae doesn't try to accommodate. They just want to make more money on late fees and charging people to even put their loans on a forbearance.

Their interest rates are so high they rip the students off. So finally I obtained a loan and had just received all the copies of the loan statements and went ahead and paid them all off by check and sent the money in. The next month I get another statement stating I owed more interest as while the checks were en route they tacked on more interest. What a piece of garbage they are. I talked to a supervisor which was like talking to someone that had nothing other than a title of supervisor. They told me ""Too bad"". So I had to pay another 90 dollars in interest.

2015-07-15 16:28:10,"Palestine , WV",Shelby,1.0,"This was my only option for a student loan my senior year of college. I just started making payments at the beginning of the year of $100. The due date for my payment didn't line up with my pay days, so I would schedule a payment online so they saw I was attempting to make the payment. The day after the payment due date, I would receive 5-6 calls a day! Made call to Customer Service, was told they can't control the calls because I didn't call them to make the payment schedule. Meanwhile I have a newborn at my house where they were calling at 8 am... NEVER will I recommend this company. They have no interest in helping you with payment arrangements or anything of that matter. The customer service reps do not even seem interested in helping either."

They were my only option for a loan when I signed up for the Joe Blasco School. Since I have finished school and while I was attending, I have been making payments of over $100 a month. Yet, I'm paying over $200 in interest now, more than a car payment!!! This company has no desire to help people. They want to take all your money. I would suggest picking a different school, if this loan company is your only option."
2015-07-03 13:09:49,"Las Vegas, NV",Kimberly,1.0,"Sallie Mae denied me a student loan, but said I could get one with a cosigner. My aunt and uncle cosigned for me only because Sallie Mae told us that after I had made one year of on time payments to my loan they could be taken off as cosigners. After I had made more than a year of on time payments I called Sallie Mae and asked to have my aunt &amp; uncle removed, only to be told I could ""APPLY"" to have them removed. Apply?! This was never told to us when we discussed the terms of my loan and having a cosigner, they had only stated you can have them taken off after you make one year/12 months of on time payments, NEVER were we told that I actually had to apply to have them removed. Very deceitful practices."

I am trying to give them my business because this is who the school recommends. It has been 45 days for when I applied for the loan along with a co-signer and not two, three, four associates give me the same answer. I spoke with a loan underwriter two weeks prior to writing this and not one note was made and my loan application is still ""under review"". I start school in 8 days from today. Worst company ever. If you can somehow get a loan from a credit union or anywhere but S.M., I recommend this. The worst company ever and every one of the associates need to be fired, ASAP."

They say that they do not see payments I've made, then ask how much I paid, once they see that I haven't paid the minimum amount they feel I should pay. They attempt to force me to pay the amount they want me to pay and pay it over the phone. I explain that I do that then in 24 hours two payments would have posted and that would put me in a negative balance so I'll wait for the first payment to post then pay whatever else I can pay for that month. They see everything we do on their monitors, they try to convince consumers to pay more. They are not Navient or Sallie Mae workers, they are collections agencies who work Sallie Mae and Navient accounts and they utilize whatever tactics they can to get you to pay more on your account even if that means them not seeing a payment in efforts for you to pay more. These companies' payment process should be regulated by the government to ensure that ethical payment practices are in place. Because this is truly unethical... almost makes me want to renounce my citizenship and move elsewhere."

It's called accountability. Quit blaming others. I took out loans through Sallie Mae for grad school and have had no issues. But then again, I went back to school for a degree that means something and live within my means. I only have ~$6k left after about 2 yrs. Might pay it off 7 yrs ahead of schedule."
2015-06-05 07:06:52,"Encino, CA",Vasiliy,1.0,"I had 2 private loans with Sallie Mae. I think the biggest problems students have is that when they are fresh in schools and have new credit history they can't take loans with good interest rates. I got my loans on average around 9%. I had total $55K. When I graduated and built my credit history I was trying hard to refinance my loans. Sallie Mae did not care at all, even when I told them numerous times that I had trouble with repayment. Eventually I refinance my loans with Wells Fargo at a lower rate and now finally refinanced with Meetearnest **. These guys gave me the lowest rate on the market and they really work with you. I also tried SoFi.com but they have some strict rules. I think social financing works really well in favor of people who struggle with high interest loans. I wish social financing came earlier. I can't believe how much money I gave in interest alone to Sallie Mae. Worst experience ever!"

They gave me the direct number to call and said they would direct me over the phone. Guess where I ended up? BACK at tech support. Hung up and called the number, answered as automated Sallie Mae that redirected me again BACK to tech support.

2015-05-11 16:16:00,"Woodside, NY",Lindley,1.0,"I've cosigned 3 separate loans for a Sallie Mae account. Their new website that was launched sometime in 2014 or 2013 doesn't list all the accounts on one screen in a user friendly way. In order to see the balance for each account, you have to select the individual ones and take note of each loan summary. I have federal loans as well, and the federal loan website can do this, it's crazy that a private loan company can't provide better service.I just called them as the most recent issue is that I'm trying to view my statements for each individual account. After selecting the individual account itself, then I click 'Statements' that reroutes me to another site with all my Sallie Mae statement information for that specific account. I find what I need, then I go back to the 'Sallie Mae Online' portal and select another one of my accounts. I select 'statements' again, but instead of routing me to the statements portal for the account I had selected, it routes me to the original account that I had already seen. I've called them about this issue and I didn't get an assurance that I expected that it'll be taken care of. It sounds like a computer glitch, but their response initially is that 'it's not normal and it might be a computer glitch'. I had to ask if it was going to be followed up on and corrected, after that they said yes, but it didn't seem like so as it wasn't their department.I then asked if they could email me the information I needed as I couldn't access my information. They told me no, but they can send it via post-mail which takes 5 days to process and then 10 days to print. 5 days to go into my account, press print, and then 10 days to put in an envelope, post-mark and have their mail office send out. A total of two weeks to get the information that should be accessible online. Two weeks to get my information. It seems crazy that when they want to be paid on time, I get emails, letters and phone calls.It's clear that Sallie Mae does not put their customers first and it's not a priority for them to make information accessible to their consumer. Their priority is to give you the product you need, and then get their share of it back as soon as possible. Terrible company, shop around before committing to loans from such a big company that won't care about your needs when you try to plan, budget and pay on time."

I took out a loan with Sallie Mae not knowing any better. When I began having financial problems after getting out of school, their representatives called me relentlessly. They were rude, unprofessional and demanding. It was like dealing with the Mafia. I paid them a certain amount 1 time via my debit card (a BIG Mistake!) and then they charged me double that amount without my permission and knowledge. I was broke at the time and this caused me to go into negative with my bank account. I was so furious. They are Horrible! They are crooks and are very sketchy. DO NOT GET A LOAN via Sallie Mae.

Coupled with my federal loans I was given $50,000 over what my education cost. Now 10 years later a home, a nephew I have custody of, I barely make ends meet. My federal loans even adjusted one of my loans to $5/month due to my debt to income ratio. Sallie Mae has ruined my credit. There is absolutely no way I can pay Sallie Mae. They are private loans so they can't do wage garnishment so I've just let them go. But because I'm an upstanding citizen that works, tries my best to pay MY bills, I am an RN in a rural ER in southern rural WV, but because of Sallie Mae I'll never be able to finance anything in my name the rest of my life.I believe they prey on young impressionable youth that are shooting for their dreams, and they should be held accountable and their loans should be extinguishable by bankruptcy. It's the only hope any of us have. I have months I can't pay my power bill... or heat... but I studied and got the American Dream right? I want my masters and am starting the process. Let's see if my credit score due to them prevents me from that too. If that's the case I may take it to a lawyer because I don't know what else I can do."

If it doesn't post tomorrow, then it probably will the next day! This is a relentless company. They call 8-9 times per day. There should be some legal recourse for such harassment."
2015-04-16 19:56:37,"Levittown, NY",Rich,1.0,"I'll make this brief as possible: I had to take out a 3rd party loan from Sallie Mae because it was my only choice. I had one semester left of school, and my government loans ran out because I got stuck having to take an extra semester. Boy oh boy. I didn't get hired until 7 months after graduation. Because I had been working a minimum wage job, bills had been accumulating and I fell behind on many of them. Sallie Mae being one of them. They do not comprehend that I only make 35k a year entry level and have so many other expenses to take care of. They don't care either.They call NONSTOP. My phone, my house phone, my parents, my friends, everyone. I have been making payments every month, but I am of course behind on payments. I am trying my hardest to make ends meet. But they do not care. The woman on the phone was EXTREMELY RUDE. I was astonished at how rude she was. She did what they call ""Financial Check"" and ask you how much you spend on each segment of your life. Car payments, Food, rent, etc. The woman on the phone was so snarky. She said a forbearance request would cost $50 for it to go through. I said I had $20 in my checking at the moment. She went on to say ""So how are you even going to pay the forbearance request with that?"" I told her I'd borrow it from a friend. She was like ""um yeah whatever."" So RUDE. I wanted to hang up there and then.If you have your payment scheduled but you are behind on the balance, they will continue to call no matter what. If I had the money right now, I would pay. But since they won't let me take a 3 month forbearance to catch up on my balance, what do they want me to do? I work full time and even took a weekend job as of recent. Oh wait. They DON'T CARE. They just want their money and they want it NOW!"

They started to threaten me telling me that they would go after our home and jobs. My son's job in the military was cut for budgets. He called Sallie Mae to ask if they could help at the time. No, they were rude and made things worse, they told me he was just paying the interest. So I took out a loan and now paying 800 for 5 yrs.

His parents home! Think twice or even thrice before you sign a contract with BIG operations that will soon go down anyways. We have a son ourselves and are flat broke. The circumstances are that of ever middle class American now. They DO NOT care if they cause you and your whole family to starve as long as they get the worthless printed money!

2015-03-14 15:06:18,"St Michael, MN",Josh,1.0,"I took out a student loan in 2010 to pay off tuition and fees. I was talked into a ""smart"" student load by a representative from Sallie Mae. I was to pay off increments of $25 a month before the deferred loan kicked in after I graduated, I was told it would save me over $1,000 in interest before I graduated. I ended up paying $75 a month to try and get ahead. I wasn't told that these payments stayed at $25 a month and all extra would be forwarded to the next months.After I graduated I started receiving my full amount checks to pay back. I was being charged 11.8% for my student loan. So I ended up paying over $250 a month after graduation. I called back numerous times to change my rate since I am a veteran from OEF and the interest rate is too high for my expenses. I was told by a Sallie Mae rep. that I can't get a veterans rate because I was deployed BEFORE I took out the loan. That hurt, then I found out from the rep. that I can't reduce my interest rate because I took out the 'Smart' student loan option.I can't believe how unethical this company is. I am still struggling trying to fix this problem and it has been almost 3 years that I have been getting charged a ridiculous amount of interest. I have heard that Sallie Mae has been overcharging veterans and had to reimburse their customers, but I haven't seen any payments. I know that Sallie Mae has turned into Navient, but no one is helping. It makes me worry for my kids when they grow up and want to attend college."

When I called to Sallie Mae, I received direction how to pay off loan with high interest. I send my payment with letter to them. After 3 weeks nothing happened; when I called they told me to wait 'til next week, maybe they will get my check. Where was my letter with payment, I do not know. After mortgage company reviewed my credit, there were still 2 loans with just with lower balance. They split my payment between two loans. When I called there they told me there is just main loan. What is mean main loan?? They promised me to fix it in 2 days. After week I was on conference call between SM, mortgage loan office and me. Again they promised fix their mistake. Again nothing happened. They gave me their directions how to make this payment and know they are trying to blame me for mistake. Today I called again, and again just promise. My closing day is scheduled on March 13th but will not happen 'til they will fix numbers in my loans. I am really angry and very upset with their practices. How they can split payment between 2 loans and assure me there is just main loan. I have 2 accounts with different numbers and different rates (!!!!) Taken in different time!!"
2015-02-25 00:06:42,"Kennesaw, GA",Erin,1.0,"I set up auto-debit maybe four months ago. I always check to make sure I've paid on time. Every month since then, I receive refund checks for Sallie Mae saying I've overpaid my bill. For the last two months, I've been called daily and received messages saying I am delinquent. Even though my account says I am not. I pay what they tell me to and sure enough they send me a refund. They told me it was because auto-debit takes a while to kick in. Whatever. I was assured it would be good to go February. However, I'm still getting delinquency calls.I call a representative to explain the situation, promising to send her screenshots of the changing values of my account summary and due amounts, screens of my bank statement to prove I paid and was not refunded *through my bank* for any errors in processing. The rep, depressed sounding girl, gives me the wrong fax number and tells me there's no other way to send documents. As you can imagine, they never got the fax ($13) and there was in fact an easy way to send it online.By the fourth rep., I get the information on how to upload my files online to prove I was not delinquent. I've received yet another refund check for overpaying *this* month. Yes, I'm on the phone with Sallie Mae who is telling me I haven't paid while also holding a check from them telling me I've paid too much. They literally cannot keep track of their own money. It's insane."
2015-02-24 23:25:29,"Round Rock, TX",Christina,1.0,"I have a significant amount of student debt from Sallie Mae. I was never told when I accepted these loans that Sallie Mae would require me to pay them in full in 10 years and that they would set the amounts of repayment. I have tried everything in my power to negotiate a payment that would meet their requirements. I am about to finish their rate reduction plan. I had missed 3 student loan payments due to health issues and was offered to sign up last February. I received a letter in the mail asking me to call and resubmit information. The first phone call I had was with a hateful young woman. Every time I would tell her how much my bills were, she would make terrible comments like ""You don't have to have that,"" or ""You can do with less."" She also said that if I continued to call them, they would take action against my co-signers (my parents) and require them to submit a credit report to show proof ""they couldn't cover this loan."" My parents are disabled and have no money. I was so hurt by her comments. So after disclosing my personal financial information, she said ""You are not accepted for rate reduction and you can do with less to make the whole payment. It will be $1,000."" This is instead of $520. I work for the Texas Board of Nursing. I make less now to work for the Board than I did as a manager in the hospital. What do I have to do to catch a break? So, I called back and a nicer young woman asked me to call back tomorrow (2/24). So, I did. I accumulated more bills and showed where all my money is going. And again I was told that the money I spent on uniforms for my husband and I are too much and the money I spent on eating out can be ""reduced."" And I can make the whole payment. I asked for policies or paperwork showing the ""expected income for someone in my position or the expected expenses I am suppose to have."" The gentleman said no paperwork existed and it's lender discretion. Is it really lender discretion to decide where I can eat or how to support our nephew who is living with us? Is it my fault I have to spend $550 for my work to take 60 days to repay it for expenses while performing my job? Is it my fault I have to have dental work and spend $4,000 last year and $3,000 this year to ensure I am not in pain? How do they get to tell me what is the right way for me to live my life? Why did I not receive documentation when I signed for my student loan how much payments would be per month? Why do people who buy homes have more rights than I do as a student? Do you think I knew that I would take the money out and have to spend 1/3 of my paycheck? Where would I live? How would I get to work? They are a hateful company. They call me, my parents, my work and harass me. How many people take their own lives because the grief and embarrassment Sallie Mae has caused them? I understand that Sallie Mae has 63 lobbyists, where are the students' lobbyist? No one should be allowed to dictate that all loans should be repaid in 10 years. At least give me enough time to pay off this loan like a house. At least the mortgage lender gets 30 years. This is shameful."
2015-02-24 14:35:33,"Fayetteville, OH",Connie,2.0,"I applied for a second loan back 2005 and was denied. Then before graduation I received a statement from Sallie Mae stating I owed for two loans. I never received the second loan, and was told by Sallie Mae customer Service that Clark State cashed the check. I requested copies of my signature and I have yet to see proof. I still have a loan of 11,000 and only owe half that. This is what I call fraud by the college or Sallie Mae. Either way I have yet to get help by Sallie Mae and have to seek a lawyer to prove I do not owe the second loan. I think Sallie Mae should go after the college and find out why they cash the check and did not give me the credit."
2015-02-24 13:34:20,"Warren, PA",Kim,1.0,"I had an account with Sallie Mae. At first my payments were very reasonable. How quickly that all changed. Every 6 months or so they would try to increase my payments until they finally got the point where I couldn't pay what they were asking. When I would ask why my payments were constantly being changed, I was told that it was so they knew I was serious about paying my loan. I'm sorry but when I make my payment on time every month I'm pretty sure that's showing I'm serious. Then when my payments started coming out of my checking account two weeks before the scheduled time causing my other bills to bounce, I was forced to close my checking account. I informed them that I was closing the account after the third month straight of them taking the payment before the scheduled date. So having closed my checking account, the next month I mailed them a cashiers check straight from the bank for the amount due.Short time after that I received a letter from Sallie Mae with the cashier check stapled to the letter with the word void across the center of the check stating that they do not accept any form of payment other than automatic withdraw from a checking account. So once again I contacted someone and informed them of the situation and why I closed my checking account and that was no good for them. So instead of trying to work it all out they sent me directly into collections. When I faxed the collection agency the letter and voided check they sent my account back to Sallie Mae who in turn kept sending it to one agency after another. If I had known this is the grief I would have gone through, I would have never gone to college. Word of advice for those who plan on going to college and plan on paying for your schooling on your own like I did... DO NOT USE SALLIE MAE!"

This time I sent the final payment on Feb 4th to arrive around the 11th. When I first called several days ago they said give it 48 hrs to post. The next time I called it was the bank's fault they may have stopped the check. You may have sent it to the wrong address, funny same address as before. You can cancel the check (my cost 27.00). But if we got it we would have cashed it. We can check internally and if we find it we will give you credit. How long will that take, 5-7 days, bingo more interest on the loan. I asked ""how about my bank sends me a copy of the check that was written on the 4th in the next 5 min and I forward it on to you"". ""We can do an internal check"". Great service! All I wanted was someone to admit they lost the check this time!"

Over the last few months, I have continued to receive numerous calls telling me that my account is past due. I have tried for months, even months prior to the calls starting, to notify Sallie Mae that they had an erroneous graduation date listed. Every technician I spoke with on the phone tells me a different story. One says I'm good to go and will stop receiving calls, then when the calls don't stop, I call back only to hear that the last person I spoke with was wrong and I have to do something else in order to clear up the mistake. I'm completely fed up. The crazy thing is that they can see every single call I've made and the only reply I get is, ""I don't know why the last person you talked to told you that.""

2015-02-12 18:07:17,"Leicester, MA",David &amp; Sherri,1.0,"It all started when my son tried to work something with Sallie Mae. He told them he couldn't pay almost $600 a month on what he makes. So after a couple of months of getting nowhere with Sallie Mae they came after me (his father). At this point we tried talking to them but unless all three of us (my son, my wife and I) there was nothing they could do for us. We will start my son lives in California and my wife and I live in Massachusetts. My son flew home in January and we called Sallie Mae with all three of us on the phone. They asked what we made and came back and said between all three of you, you three can afford the almost $600 a month. At that point my son went back to California and left his mother and I to deal with Sallie Mae. So we have been talking to Sallie Mae and my wife finally worked it out with them and setup an automatic withdrawal from her bank account. At first they had one number written down wrong on their end. At this point some lady from Sallie Mae calls at 11am and request us to call her back that something is not going through at their end. On the same day 15 minutes later, she calls again and starts ranting that we are ignoring her phone calls. Then 15 minutes later she calls again and leaves almost the same message. When my wife gets home, she calls and talks to them and finds out the discrepancy. So we are all set wrong, we get another phone call and Sallie Mae says that my wife bank card expires next month and they won't be able to take out a payment. So she calls her bank and her bank says that is not true her card expires at the end of the month and they can withdraw a payment at anytime that month and a new card will be issued before the end of the month. So a few days later they call and say now the payment has to come from a joint account. So my wife and I agree to put the payment on our joint bank account and tell them to call back later in the day when we are home together. They never call and my wife left a message on the lady's machine that we are both home. She never called back. Then I get another phone call from Sallie Mae and they are threatening me again that I have not made a single payment in 125 days. At this point I inform the lady as usual, she like everybody else there, they don't know what they are talking about and inform her we just made a payment. At this point she says oh hold on. Now steps in Max her supervisor and he tries telling me everything I told he people already. Then he says why don't I call you back tonight when your wife is home and we will put it on the joint account. So I confirm with him that he has permission to call me after 6pm when my wife will be home from work. As I am writing this letter I still have not received a phone call from Sallie Mae."
2015-02-12 05:19:03,"White Plains, NY",alyssa,1.0,"Hands down worst customer service I have ever dealt with. I have the private smart option loan so basically that means you can't ever change the payment under any circumstance. Especially when you are having a hard time making ends meet. I tried to lower my payment and the only option I was given was to default on my loans for three months, let it affect my credit and then they would work with me. Sounds really logical right? I lost the .25% credit for auto debit because of 2 different issues with my bank and now Sallie Mae will not ever offer it on my 4 private loans with interest rates all north of 9%. I also no longer receive the 2% discount to my Upromise account and there is just simply no explanation for that when I try to get an answer from Sallie Mae and Upromise. It's really sad that this monster company that makes millions of dollars cannot even improve upon these little things. Then again when you are the top of the business and students have no other options...they do not care. I will do anything to get rid of these loans with Sallie Mae to not give them anymore money."
2015-02-09 23:41:40,"Saugus, MA",Sean,1.0,I was mislead and over charged in terms of high interest rates. I was told my loans would be consolidated into one loan. They in fact made two different so they could make more money on interest. Please do not use Sallie Mae or Navient!
2015-02-07 00:25:01,"Fontana, CA",Christine,5.0,"My father co-signed for a school loan for me. I was making payments, then I lost my job, and had trouble paying it. Sallie Mae dropped my father's credit score from the mid 800's to 400. Can they do this, is this legal? That is quite drastic and damaging. What recourse do we have, and can we get any help to remedy this? My father is elderly &amp; this is devastating to him. Please can anyone advise?"
2015-01-30 05:59:03,"Phillipsburg, NJ",John,1.0,"I went to school from 2003 to 2007. Within that time my dad was injured at work and our family didn't have extra money for me to go to school. Since I had already started I wasn't just going to quit. After receiving my student loans from Pennsylvania Department of Education. I was left a balanced $8000 for each year I had left. This is where the predators or Sallie Mae comes in. They see that you are 2 years into school you have no other options but to finish, then they set the trap, knowing that a 20 year old kid will sign anything to stay in school. (SMH dirt bags) I wound up borrowing close to $30,000 from them. After graduation, I found a good job and started paying on the loan immediately. I was then the victim of layoffs in 2008. As you know those were some of the hardest economic times since the depression. I had to take a job washing dishes just to get by. I obviously could not afford the payments anymore. I went back to school and after begging them to give me forbearance, I was denied. Now theyre saying I owe them $108,000 and I am never paying them a cent until they remove that interest. They called my friends, work, sister, brother, uncle, cousin, and anyone else they could find. The CSR would say things like, Can you pay Johns bills because he cant? Why doesnt he stop being lazy and take a job at McDonalds? Things like that. They harass my father every night because he is the co-signer. My dad is a disabled Veteran who fought in Vietnam. Does that even matter to this country anymore? They call him all types of names. I am so tired of these people. Even with all these harassing phone calls they cant even locate any documentation that would prove I owe this amount. They wont show me, they wont help me, they wont explain anything to me, they wont work with me, and for that I wont pay them. They can keep calling all they want. It doesn't matter to me anymore. They have already ruined my credit. I am not sure I can ever live a normal life without fear of a credit check. People use your credit as means to determine your character and it isn't right. These people call my family, friends, place of work, and say terrible things about my father and I. I know that is not legal. Can someone help me? My credit is ruined. Even when I apply for a job they now do credit checks. It makes people think I dont pay my bills. With this amount of debt I cant even start my young life. I was always told that going to college would help me, but all it has done is put me in a huge hole. I am now a certified history teacher and in an incredible amount of debt. If a kid asks me if he or she should go to college or not, Im not sure what to advise them. Should I say, Only if you have the money? You tell me Sallie Mae."
2015-01-27 20:44:25,"Minnetonka, MN",Sara,1.0,"I would never recommend this loan provider to anyone. Bottom line is, I have worked with them now for 5 years, and every time I call, I feel like a completely undervalued customer.

I regret taking out student loans from this company, and having to pay them back to such a company. Horrible on all levels."

When I needed a forbearance, they denied me because of my Co-signer financial situation and harassed my co-signer and me all hours of the day and night when my payment would be one day late. I ended up getting a personal loan to pay my payoff balance in full $12801 on 1/15, then they charge me $82 on 1/16/15. I called in again and paid the ""pay off"" amount. Now they are sending a statement for even more money?!! The only way to get a hold of a live person is to call the collections department. But even then they can't give me an answer. Today it was ""I've emailed my manager to close the account, it should be closed in a couple days"" but they can't give me a confirmation or let me talk to someone who can actually close the account. I've been hung up on ""accidentally"" numerous times, sat on hold for countless minutes. Been redirected and listened to several automated systems that end up hanging up on me. This by far is the worst company I have ever dealt with, I would never refer this company even to my worst enemy."
2015-01-20 22:44:24,"Aurora, CO",Adam,1.0,"I had originally taken a loan through Sallie Mae in 2012 to pursue a further education and career by going to flight school. The loan was a substantial amount, being that a specialized training like this is not cheap. Unfortunately because it does not fall under ""education"" it was/ is considered a private unsecured loan. I knew that the payments that I would have to make would be large but I figured manageable and would be justified as my career would compensate, but I could not have been more wrong. The minimum monthly payments that they are demanding are extremely high and between myself and my father who is my co signer, we are still unable to afford that amount each month. The larger issue is that it is not about us not wanting to pay, in fact we have offered them as much as we would be able to pay per month, which has meant nothing to them. Their reply is simply either we pay all or nothing. We have attempted to enroll in four different what they call ""programs"", to try and make our monthly payment manageable and in each case they have set up a direct withdrawal and taken multiple payments, then called a month or two later only to tell us that our ""program"" was denied and we are behind in payments. At this point I am beyond frustrated and feel helpless as to what I can do to maintain my credit because this company is unwilling to work with us and will probably leave a horrible mark on my credit and future financial ability."

Unfortunately I had to leave state due to my own safety from domestic violence. When I came back to Tampa and claimed my taxes, thanks to Sallie Mae I was on the street with my toddler and newborn. They took every penny of it when I was never notified of it and I really didn't know that me going to that school for 3 months only was gonna leave me a debt of more than $10k. Called them up and explained to them the situation and of course I never got a dime back. They are horrible and some people that I have seen trying to go back to school, I stop them for a second and I let them know about Sallie Mae. They are horrible and I do not regret at all telling my story to innocent people trying to go back to school, to make the right choice and go with another loaner."

Once able to contact they informed me that X amount was due monthly. Still in school? Regardless I said I can't pay the amount they are demanding but I can pay Y amount. They said they would not accept that and would only accept what they were requesting. Terrible help. Horrible chore to find contact information and reach them.

My student loan payments are more than my housing. Now, not only do I carry the burden of this debt, which I did willingly, I now have to carry the burden of this organizations selfish, money hungry acts...

We have requested a written agreement several times and have yet to receive it. We have kept a log of our calls and who we have spoken to with each promising to send a written agreement yet none has been sent. I have even threatened to stop payment until it is sent and still nothing. I am totally frustrated with this company.

I applied solo, with my dad, with my mom and with my grandma all of which have great credit and I continuously get denied... ughhhhh, this is so frustrating. How are these places supposed to be there to help you, yet treat you like crap and then cannot give you ANY info as to what might help you pass the qualification process.

I believe that if they do have several class action lawsuits against them we should be compensated. I also found out that they just closed a case and checks went out in March of this year 2014 and I wasn't informed about this until I called the student loan forgiveness company. This is unjustly and I know several others that went through the same thing including my sisters. I would like to know if someone could contact me asap because I want this matter to be solved and to be compensated for this and everything else they done did.

They would say all they need is this paper and we would send it, then they would say they needed another. This went on for almost a month - all the way to they wanted a marriage certificate for me and my wife. What does that have to do with a loan. They should have ran my credit and know if I am good for it. I got tired of dealing with them. Called my bank and had the money in 10 minutes.

My school ASU and the Feds require that I send a Private Loan Certification to my lender. How do I do that? One may ask. The year is 2014 and the only way to contact Sallie Mae is by telephone? Strange. ""Sallie Mae owns $162.5 billion of student debt."" So you would think they could afford to have an email address and pay someone to manage it. So I call the 1 (800) 472-5543 number, enter in my SSN, wait on hold for 15 minutes. And the first thing I am asked for is my SSN again? Okay strange. Why do I need to enter in my SSN # if the Customer Service line doesn't receive it?After they ask all the identifying questions, she tells me that I owe money. I said thanks, but the reason for my call is to find out who can I send this Private Loan Certification to? She quickly says, You called the wrong number. This is the number you need: 1-800-695-3317. Again, the year is 2014, you would think they could forward you. But that's not the case with the Sallie Mae Company. So I called that number. Entered in my SSN # again and again waited about 20 minutes. Service is fast here!...not. I will be paying these loans back for at least 10 years and be spending THOUSANDS of dollars. You would think that they would provide a little better customer service but that would seem to be asking for too much. So I ask my question again, who can I send this Private Loan Certification to? She paused and said, ""well this is the wrong number."" You can imagine how upset a paying customer would be to have to play the ring and pony show. So I said, you have got to be ** kidding me!? You wouldn't believe what she said then nothing. She hung up on me. So today I wasted roughly 45 minutes speaking to imbeciles that I pay for. Literally, I would advise to go another route with another lender. Someone who appreciates your money and smiles at you when they rob you blind."

Sallie Mae makes it next to impossible to pay your loans if you live abroad but don't have an American bank account. You can make card payments over the phone for a $14.00 fee and a $50 phone bill once they figure out how to get your postcode into the system. This happens every time I've paid, for 10 years! That means I've paid $7680 in fees just to make a payment over the years. I've complained countless times but the company NEVER has had the courtesy to respond. Surely a company as big as Sallie Mae can figure out how to create the ability to make online card payments. Every other company in the world does this. Or is being in the dark ages a really convenient way to make tons of money off internationals? Sallie Mae should be ashamed of itself. Me and thousands of others think so!"

The school, Northern Arizona University didn't tell me the terms of the private loan called GradExcel or any others. I did not know that supposedly while I am still in school, I am required to start paying back on those loans. They lowered the one loan to 54-56 dollars a month; however, I am supposed to pay over $150 per month in a few months. I get $691 a month in SSI. I sent them the information three times until they finally found it when the loan was overdue. They said they will postpone payments until next month; however, I still have to pay $100 for forbearances every 3 months and about $54 a month for the student loan that will not forbear anymore. I asked them if they don't have any income sensitive program. They said no. For some reason they won't let me see the contract. I am just told that it has expired after ten years and I have to pay whether I am disabled or in school. This was not my understanding of the terms when I signed the contract at NAU. I was told that after 2 years after paying $150 per month I have to pay $500 a month.

2014-10-10 02:19:05,"Fort Wayne, IN",Elizabeth,1.0,"I am incredibly upset with Sallie Mae. I have NEVER missed a payment thanks to automatic payments. I have private loans and federal loans with Sallie Mae. On 9/12/14, I called to set up a forbearance on my student loans due to temporary unemployment when switching to a new job. My bill was not due until 9/27/14. I talked to a gentleman named Ahmed. He set me up with a forbearance for $150 days before my payment was due. I paid this forbearance fee on the phone with him. I had asked for a 1 or 2 month forbearance. He told me that $150 was for 3 MONTHS, as that is the minimum amount you can do a forbearance. He explained that for each loan, there is a lifetime limit of 12 months of forbearance, but they are in 3 month increments. He said I can opt for a 1-2 month forbearance, but the 3 month forbearance fee would be the same amount. So I said, sure - let's just do 3 months! He said my next payment is due on Dec. 27.I asked Ahmed about my automatic payments, since I still am paying on my federal loans. He told me that I wouldn't need to change anything on my online account because when the forbearance is processed, it will show a $0 balance on my private loans. So I rephrased my question to make sure I understood that I didn't need to change my automatic payments. Again, I was told I wouldn't have to do anything to my online account and my standard monthly balances will zero out.After 9/27/14, I am doing my monthly budget and I log onto my online banking. What do I see? SM took out not only my $150 forbearance fee but ALSO my standard monthly payment for my private loans that were supposed to be in forbearance! Not only did I have to file a dispute with my bank, I called SM's customer service. The lady was incredibly nice and said, ""Yes. This was a mistake. You are on forbearance for 3 months. We will refund the standard monthly payment back to your bank account."" She recommended that I remove the automatic payment from my online account to prevent this from happening again. So I did while I was on the phone with her. A few business days later, I was refunded the monthly payment amount that they withdrew.On 10/2/14, I received multiple phone calls from SM. When I called SM back after I got off work, a lady in customer service told me I was past due on my balance. I explained to her that my private loans are in forbearance until December. I told her everything that happened 1 month prior. She said that she read the notes and that she could see that $150 was taken out for a 3-month forbearance and that the additional standard monthly payment was taken out and refunded back to my bank account. She said she would take care of it and that I didn't owe anything for 9/27/14.Out of curiosity, I logged into my SM account online on 10/8/14. It showed that my account was past due for my private loans! However, my federal loans were paid up to date. There was a delinquent notice on my online account! So I called customer service again to double check. This time, I called the billing department. The woman on the phone from the billing department told me that information was getting lost between customer service and billing. She said that she did see that my account was in forbearance and she could trace everything I said. She told me she was going to take care of it and that my account was not delinquent. Again, she told me that I was correct and that my next payment isn't due until Dec. 27.TODAY (10/9/14), I received more than 5 phone calls from SM. I was busy all day, so I couldn't answer right away. Around 9 PM, I received another call that I was able to take. When I answered, the woman on the phone was from COLLECTIONS! She told me that I was past due for 2 months! I told her the same story. She began to tell me that since I was in collections that the maximum forbearance she could do was 1 month. Again, I told her that I was not supposed to be collections because I am in forbearance currently for September, October, and November. My next payment isn't due until Dec. 27. She tried to tell me that I was incorrect! I got very angry and told her she was wrong. She said she would get her manager. Her manager gets on the phone and tries to tell me that the maximum forbearance they could do was 1 month. I told her that I am in forbearance until Dec. 27th! I wasn't supposed to be in collections in the first place! She said she sent an email to corporate letting them know my story and that my ""delinquent"" account is supposed to be in forbearance until Dec. 27th. I told her my account is NOT delinquent, and I have spoken to customer service and billing multiple times to get this straightened out - and obviously it hasn't been resolved on their end. I asked her if this has hit my credit. She told me that SM does not report to credit bureaus on delinquent accounts until 90 days past due and my account is currently 60 days past due. Again, I reminded her that I am not delinquent and that I am in fact in forbearance until Dec. 27th!! I will dispute this if it does hit my credit! I asked her if I needed to follow up and when I should expect this to be resolved. She told me to call back in 3 days. Today is Thursday. In 3 days, it will be Sunday. SM has a scheduled power outage for the weekend where all online accounts and phone lines will be unavailable. I reminded her of this and asked ""Do I call on Sunday or do I call on Monday?"" She laughed and said, ""Oh! So you have been reading your emails and the alerts! You are correct! That is happening this weekend!"" Somehow, this manager forgot about a SCHEDULED POWER OUTAGE FOR AN ENTIRE WEEKEND where all call centers will not be available or online account access. This surprises me!I am very unsure of working with Sallie Mae. Their customer service, billing department and collections department do not seem to know what is going on. Their staff is not knowledgeable about their own forbearance plans or how online accounts work. They do not have an effective communication system between multiple departments. They do not handle customer complaints very well - instead they try to make it sound like their mistake is your fault. I have lost all of my trust in SM since they obviously did not correct the problem in a reasonable amount of time to get a resolution to the problem. They really need to get it together. If this problem is not resolved by Monday 10/13/14 - I would NOT recommend anyone using Sallie Mae for academic financing. This is enough to leave a bad reputation with a customer who never had any previous issues with Sallie Mae."
2014-10-07 21:28:03,"Englewood, OH",Lea,1.0,"I have multiple loans with Sallie Mae, and have tried my best to make the payments. Earlier this year, they called my phone daily about getting my payments caught up, even though I was unemployed for a bit. DAILY THEY CALLED, if they didn't speak directly with me, they would leave multiple voicemails until they called. When I said I couldn't make a payment at that time, they said I would continue to get calls daily, and I would have to agree to a direct withdraw of payments to be put on any kind of assistance. Yup, that's right. I had to agree to a monthly draft of the payment or else the collection calls would keep going everyday. Even if I had sent in a payment. I finally was able to get caught up, but have since missed a payment or two (well actually late payment). Now they are hounding me again. Daily calls, emails, letters over the one missed payment. Collection threats. I make less than $25k per year, I am single Mom of three. I have to give up my account information for auto payments, and they will call it even. But, if I mail the payment I stay in collection until I am all caught up. I moved to Arizona for six months, to try and find work while staying with family. The calls started at 5 am, even though I complained multiple times that I was in a different time zone than they had on record. They just told me that they were going off my area code to my cell phone, and they would keep calling at 8 am Ohio time. REALLY wish I had never gone back to school!!! This is torture."

The conversation started with requests for personal ID information. I refused until the guy would tell me the purpose of the call. He refused to tell me why he was calling. The caller ID did not have Sallie Mae. The guy was aggressive and belligerent. I asked to talk with someone in customer service or public relations. No answers. I ended the call.My son takes care of his own finances including his student loan. A couple of times there have been snafus with online payments. I called him. SM had not contacted him in any way - phone, letter, or email. I used the number on my phone to call SM back. I asked for a supervisor. First thing, he asked for the last four digits of my social. I told him it wasn't necessary. I wanted to discuss policy. He did the usual bullying more adamantly than the caller. He would not let me contact public relations of any kind. I ended the call. It's a shame SM's employees are trained this way.I checked Sallie Mae's website. There's no way to contact SM without giving them your ID. There was no general phone number. There's no address, so I couldn't use Yelp. Do not get a Sallie Mae loan! The company uses bully tactics and is not upfront with their business. There is no real person to talk to. The frontline employees are trained to intimidate no matter what the problem. My son was never contacted. Both of us have tried to straighten up their contact information over the years."

I have more than 1 type of loan with them and you are transferred a minimum of 5 times before you get to someone who can ""access"" the account. Out of 5 of the people I spoke to today 2 of them were extremely rude and spoke down to me the entire time. The conversation ended in tears and with the issue not resolved. ""Go call your other creditors and ask them to lower their payments"" was his best advice. When I was asking them to honor the program I was already in and making on time payments to them. Nothing has changed since I began the program financially so I don't understand how my financial statement has suddenly changed by their standards to kick me out of that program now. I was told when I signed off on this program that I just had to make on time payments in this program to be able to stay in it and I have not had 1 late payment.They are rude, don't help you until you are really delinquent, and are not very well organized. They sometimes lump checks and only put towards 1 account causing the other to fall behind (that's with account numbers written on checks). Don't use them unless you plan on living home rent free, car insurance free, car payment free, basically no bills other than Sallie Mae for 15+ years. They are a disgrace."

Collection Agency stated I stopped making payments, even though they were taking them automatically for 1 yr.They also stated I signed paperwork in Pencil, which is untrue. When asked for the original copy, they stated they didn't have it. They stated Sallie Mae would not accept paperwork. Have called Sallie Mae 4 times in the last 6 months requesting to open a case to research this. I was asked to send all proof I had, which I did. Now they say they opened and closed it based on what collection agency told them, instead of researching case. I have proof of every transaction, I have sent them. I was told 20 days ago someone from Sallie Mae would call me back in 7-10 days, that didn't happen for the 3rd time. I called today and was told the case was closed.

If you are a young male adult with a parent cosigner and/or a daughter, thoroughly reconsider if and when you planning to attend a college with loans whether those loans are from this company or not.

When I call to find out any payment options there really aren't any except pay $50/loan to postpone a payments for 2 months. Sallie Mae calls NONSTOP, ALL day long. When is enough enough? Quite frankly it is rude, unprofessional and disruptive. They call back to back, my phone then my mother's phone, starting at 8am even on the weekends. There needs to be a limit on how many times they call per day. Or at least if you call them and let them know you are not able to make a payment yet where they can suspend phone calls.

I am 12 years into a five year note that started out at six thousand dollars. Have paid them over thirteen thousand dollars and they claim I owe them three thousand more.

2014-09-16 12:02:37,"Brooklyn, NY",Sarah,1.0,"I recently became unemployed, and I was attempting to postpone my student loan payments until my income returned. I was able to defer payments through ACS and the Department of Education. My experience calling Sallie Mae was a top to bottom disaster. I was directed to an out-of-country call center, and my representative was friendly, but difficult to understand. The major problem with this system, though, is that these call reps have basically zero power to help you if that requires deviating from their script. But I digress. So, when I called Sallie Mae, they told me that their only deferment options are for enrolled students and active members of the military. They told me that my only option was a maximum of 3 months forbearance. Having no other choice, I opted to do the forbearance. After I'd settled on this option, I was told I would be charged a $100 forbearance fee. I was very surprised, and rightfully angry. Let me make this perfectly clear. I was calling Sallie Mae to responsibly postpone payments because I don't have any money right now. I did this instead of simply not paying. And their policy is to charge people extra money if they are experiencing financial hardship. Despicable.My request would not be processed unless I agreed to pay and give them my banking information on the spot. ""Thankfully"" I was able to post-date the payment by 30 days, so let's hope I have some income by then, I guess. I never would have imagined that their customer service policies could have gotten any worse. But they have. If you can get your loans transferred to another organization, I highly recommend it. This company is, without question, the single worst organization I have EVER dealt with."
2014-09-15 21:33:57,"Oklahoma City, OK",Jaime,1.0,"My original loan through Sallie Mae (SM) was for $3,500 to go back to school. When I graduated and got a job, SM began taking a monthly payment of $75 direct deposit from my bank account for the first three years I worked at that job (3 years X 12 months = 36 months; 36 months X $75 = $2,700). SM ceased taking payments when I was enrolled in classes online between April 2011 through October 2011, but never told me they had put me in deferment for being in school.SM contacted me in October 2011 (after a move to a new city) to say that my deferment period had ended and I was now in default for not reestablishing payment. I said I had never been made aware that I had been in deferment, that we had moved, gave them my new bank information, and payments resumed at $75 a month from November 2011 to April of 2012, when I closed my account with that bank (6 months x $75 = $450). There were some tight spots, but I always assured that my SM payment had gone through, and there were several months where I made higher payments, typically between $150-$200. $2,700 + $450 = $3150. If nothing else, this loan should have dropped into the last few hundreds of dollars owed.SM's website payment information does not reflect all of these payments. At last check, their website claimed that I owed over $3,700 - this is in excess of my original loan, and there is NO conceivable way the interest rate could have collected that high. And so I told them I needed accurate payment records before I would recommence payment. They told me the payment information on their website is accurate.I have nothing to dispute their so-called ""records"" because I don't have any of my own. Yeah, I totally get that I should have kept records now, but frankly, I was naive enough to think a student loan company wouldn't actually try to screw me THAT BADLY. I have made SM an offer through the Federal Credit Protection Bureau that I would keep $1,000 for them in escrow, which was theirs as soon as I had written confirmation that this would settle anything left owed on the account (and then some). They refused the deal. So I refuse to pay them anything. Ever. Again.SM is now not only calling me multiple times a day, they contact my husband and even my mother, whose number has NEVER been associated with this account. I have filed a harassment charge against them, but they continue to demand higher and higher payments on an account that is and has been paid off, and they're reporting me to collections agencies. I will NOT be cowed by them just because they are a corporation that feels it can prey on students and citizens by charging them outlandish rates of interest. I would rather never own a home, never purchase a new car, and never be offered another credit deal, than ever relinquish to them another cent."

In June, it was time for them to reevaluate my payment plan and they did so with a modest increase in the payments required. Under their plan, they give you 3 months to make the payments to make sure that you live up to your end of the bargain before they give you 12 months at that rate and then reevaluate again. After my August payment was made, the collection calls started again in spite of the fact that I was supposed to be in the rate reduction program for another 12 months. I spoke with a representative there who told me that they had made an error (this is about the 3rd or 4th time that they have erred in my account causing me a lot of headaches trying to get it fixed) and that they would fix it and I would get no more phone calls.

My worker decided to leave the USA with his family, after telling me that it was all squared away with the loan. Sallie Mae began harassing me for repayment, which is how I found out that it was not 'squared away'. I explained that the boy had skipped with his parents. No matter. I explained that he did not go to school but for 3 weeks. No matter. IDT won't speak to me as account was in student's name only. Long and short, I must pay back the loan, even though the student did not attend. There is something wrong when the student loan rate is almost double the mortgage rate, and why should the school continue to take the installments from Sallie Mae, knowing that the child is not there.

I called and the representative took the application over the phone. In summary, my FICO scores dropped approx. 20 point because there were 3 Hard Credit Inquiries.

After 2 years of their harassing calls I began calling them trying to speak with a supervisor without success. After many more attempts without results, I received one of many final notices indicating my options again and again had changed. Without having any discussion they have increased the loan amount from $33,333 to over $70,000!!! They continue to avoid conversation, discussion or any meaningful conversations. There has been NO representative until I was told there were no more conversations (like there were any at all) and that the entire loan could be called.Since then I have contacted the Credit Reporting Agencies and disputed the loans, I have sent a registered return receipt letter requesting an in person meeting to resolve the fraudulent claims as well as any that may be legitimate. I have also asked that due to their non-responsiveness that they reduce interest, penalties and any jacked up fees. There have been claims that I have 5 of these Sallie Mae Loans which would mean I am over $500,000 in debt. Before I pay on anything I sure would like to know it's a legitimate debt.

2014-08-24 14:56:16,"Orangeburg, SC",Castine,1.0,"I have paid my student loans on time for the last 4 plus years. Prior to the so call split of federal and private loan departments at SallieMae, I sent in one payment that was equally distributed to private and federal loans. In April I received notification that there would be a split, but I should send my payments in as I normally would until further notice. In May, I sent in the payment plus additional as I normally would. A month later, I get a call saying my federal loans were behind. The private loan sector applied all of my payment to their loan and put nothing on my federal loan. I went online then and paid the past due amount for the federal loans. A representative from Sallie Mae then told me, that because all my payments tabulated to almost a $1000 dollars over the two months, she would re-appropriate the payments correctly and it should cover May and June and therefore my next payment would not be until July. The representative also gave me the amounts and account numbers, as well as mailing addresses for each account. As directed, I sent in payments on time for the Month of July. Then I got another call saying my payment for the private loans are now behind. I sat on the phone arguing with someone for over an hour, talked to a manager, who apologized and said she would take care of it. She left me a voice mail message stating that it was resolved. I still have the message. Only to get another call saying that my federal loans are now behind. I am at my wits end with the level of incompetence with regards to my account. They are bouncing customers around each side (federal vs private) and blames the other side for misappropriation of payments. They also act as if they don't talk with each other and they leave you in the middle trying to fight their battles. I am really considering contacting an attorney. This is really aggravating and a poor way to treat good customers who have been responsible in their payments. I left another message for the manager who said it had been taken care of. We will see on Monday what excuses are made regarding this problem"
2014-08-22 20:09:18,"Annapolis, MD",Chris,2.0,"I'm only giving two stars because they did help finance college and I am grateful for that but believe they practice unethical business models. Here's my issue: I recently started a Master's program at a Clearinghouse reporting university. What I didn't remember from the fine print on the loans I signed 6-10 years ago was a little thing called ""Automatic In-school Deferment"". Sallie Mae automatically places your loans in deferment when you go back to school and you don't need to give them permission. The issue with this is that these loans are private not federal, so the principal does not get paid but the interest still accrues and the federal government does not pay it for you. Why is this a big deal you ask? I'm also a service member who qualifies for the Service members Civil Relief Act where any debt accrued before joining has an interest rate cap at 6%. I had to jump through loops to prove to them I qualified and in the end, I was successful in being refunded $10,000 in overpaid interest over four years. Again, what's the big deal? Profits. Sallie Mae is a publicly traded company who is responsible to shareholders to return and increase profits. While none of their shenanigans are illegal, they are not transparent and will take advantage of any nickel they can take from you. Automatic in school deferment benefits their profits, knocking my interest rates down when they knew I was in the military didn't.Bottom line is this. It is public information that for FY14 they returned a net interest increase of $44 million and a yearly increase of INTEREST profits up 35% to $144 million. If you think they will not nickel and dime you to increase these numbers you are naive. Their customer service is somewhat polite but could care less about working for a socially irresponsible company who is not transparent with their business practices and do not care about the consumer."

We are in a mess with overdrafts charges and bank fees on top of the 28.00 dollars, they still will not refund. Today there 13 more fees at 33.00 each. They keep telling us they will take care of it and today is Aug 21, and there is still no resolve. This is clearly their error and we have made so many calls to them and are constantly getting the runaround. We had to freeze or lock our checking account because of their error and they have clearly robbed us and put us in a terrible bind. They will not cooperate in any manner with us or the bank. We have paid them faithfully, too."

As a result, I called Sallie Mae to see about deferments that may suit my current situation. They pretended that the only thing I would qualify for would be a forbearance. My loans are 159$ per month. At the end of the 6-month forbearance, I will owe them an additional 400$ in acquired interest!!!!! This is outrageous for someone who is disabled and with a good history of making payments. My daughter will be attending college soon and I can assure you she WILL NOT be applying for a loan through Sallie Mae!"

He helped me real quickly and I got to talk to a human in like 2 minutes from the start of the phone call, which is of course ideal. I used the number and email for Customer Advocate at Salliemae.com. For many months, and only recognizable in retrospect, over $5,000 was sent from my bank to Sallie Mae (per my demand) but not applied to my account. I got the email confirmations and even recorded some of the confirmation numbers, but none of the 9 transactions that totaled over $5,000 was ever applied to my loan.I called the Customer Advocate number and wrote the email address, and they said they can fix it if I can verify the bank transactions. I'm still in the process of doing this, but was surprised at how easy it was to get into contact with them. The strange thing is that these transactions were only not applied to my account when I made multiple payments on any given loan in one day. I would do this because I was paying on different loans instead of just sending all the money to my account to be split up equally. I wanted to pay off the higher interest loans first. Anyway, thousands of dollars virtually disappeared after leaving my bank, which is why EVERYONE should make sure the money they send to Sallie Mae is actually being applied to your loan. Use the number from the Customer Advocate I mentioned above. They can help like they helped me."

They allowed me to lower my payments. However, they raised my loan amount by almost $2k. It was insane. I called them again a year later because my payment amount more than tripled. They didn't tell me, they just raised it. Then they charged me more fees for not paying the right amount. It's been 8 years since I graduated and my loan is more now than when I started. They do send me an email when they receive a payment... but they don't tell me how much went to principal and how much went to interest or their made up fees.

2014-08-16 09:53:38,"Oregon, OH",Bradley,1.0,"I finished my doctoral degree in 2012. Up to that point, I had very few ill run-ins with Sallie Mae as all my loans were in deferment until I graduated. During the repayment process, a true horror story for me and my immediate family unfolded. It all began when my sister (who was also in college at the time I graduated) was accepted into a fast track RN degree. Only issue is that this would require an extra 30-40k. So, my dad tried to co-sign for her (as he had been co-signing for both me and her the whole time) and was denied. When he called several times to ask what could be done, they gave him quite the runaround. Firstly, they kept hassling him to find a different co-signer altogether for her. Ok let me stop there for a second. Dear Sallie Mae, I AM NOT GOING TO ASK MY DOG WALKER'S SON'S PIANO INSTRUCTOR'S MOM TO CO-SIGN A LOAN FOR ME. They seriously act like it's no big deal, people co-sign for 40k loans all the time... As if it doesn't even have to be a very close member of your immediate family who is also financially stable? Gimme a break...Anyways so he can't get her a school loan much to his lament after we already have 50-60k invested in her degree. He doesn't know what to do. I don't know how to help either. Then after we tell them on seriously 5-10 or more occasions we can't find a different co-signer, they tell us that they figured out what the problem was. I was messing it all up for her by my dad being the co-signer with me. They told me it is a simple solution though. We say awesome what's the solution. Answer: remove my dad as a co-signer for my loan. Sounds easy enough and makes sense. So, now I have to get involved. I met all the criteria to apply for co-signer removal. After dragging their feet for several MONTHS, and yes that is legitimate, my first contact with them was on May 5th and today is Aug 16th and talking to them dozens of times, this issue remains unresolved. I applied to have him removed. Several weeks later, it was accepted. Several more weeks later, I obtained the letter of notice that he was officially removed. Perfect. My sister then miraculously gets approved for her loan so we feel we are safe to assume everything is now all set once and for all. NOPE.My baby sister goes to take out a small 3k loan to go to community college. Dad tries to co-sign and can't do it. He calls them and they say it's because he is still active as the cosigner on my loans. We have gone through this with them a genuinely exhausting amount of times. Have called them dozens and dozens of times. My online profile has my acceptance letter and his release and they can confirm that they can see this too, but it still shows up on my dad's credit! IT GETS WORSE.So then they tell us because it is such a small amount of money to be borrowed, if we just keep trying, ""eventually"" one of the applications will go through the right avenues and be accepted. Nonsensical but whatever, ok we will try anything at this point. After applying several times in a week, my dad comes to realize that his credit score has fallen 100 points! All because he keeps applying for credit as they instructed him to do so.In conclusion Sallie Mae has single-handedly sent us from a respectable working-class family to an unaccredited poverty line family in financial turmoil. My sisters very well may not be able to finish school because of this. And my older sister is one semester away from finishing her masters! LOL. Which she will have to default on the loan if they won't give her the money to finish. It is an overly complex, convoluted web that never ends. Which is truly saddening because after federal loans run out, they are pretty much the only game in town. No bank will agree to a loan like this without collateral. However, If you have any other option not limited to selling yourself on the street or ""exotic dancing"", I would suggest do that first before taking out a loan with this ""company"". Ugh."

I called them and was told this would cleared it up. They had credited my payment to a private loan even though my payment was clearly for the amount of the student loan (a much larger amount than the private loan payment). I also indicated in the memo line that the deferment had ended. There is no separate account number for the private and educational loans (not smart). They accused me of sending it to the wrong address, but that was all electronic on my part. So, no separate accounts for the private and educational loans and after multiple calls telling them what happened and their promising to fix it, they still send me threatening letters. BTW, I only have an education loan with them because the government sold it to them. Thanks, Uncle Sam."

2014-08-11 22:36:05,"Galloway, NJ",Denise,1.0,"In 2007 my husband signed for our eldest son's student loan to attend mechanic school. I assume the financial aide officer had my husband sign because our son was only 17 at the time. Once the course was complete our son began making payments on the loan. On February 23, 2013 our son shot himself. He drifted in and out of a coma for four months and then passed away June 18th. During the time he was in the hospital I submitted forms to Sallie Mae to have the loan dismissed as he was obviously unable to work. They never responded. About a month after he passed I sent Sallie Mae a death certificate. Still no response. I had forgotten that my mother had co-signed for the loan until they started making threatening phone calls to her. Apparently almost four months after I sent the death certificate, they removed my husband's name from the loan and transferred it into my mother's name. Now they were hounding my 70 year old mother for payment of her deceased grandson's loan.My son was named after my husband. Without even comparing date of birth or any other information they assumed the signor of the loan had passed. It took months to get the loan back into the my husband's name. Now they both receive threatening letters and phone calls. Sallie Mae refuses to dismiss the loan due to untimely death of the student because my husband actually signed for the loan. My husband signed for the loan because my son was only 17. We were not financially prepared to lose our son. It took us over a year to pay off the funeral and pay for a headstone. My husband recently lost his job due to one of the casinos closing. We do not have the money to pay back this loan. Financial reasons aside. The lose of our son and the manner in which we lost him has been a heartbreak from which we will never recover. It is inhumane to remind us every month of that lose by sending us a bill for his student loan."

I spoke with a customer service representative in June 2014 about setting up monthly payments through the automatic system. I was told that $25.00 would automatically come out beginning in August. I was never told that my payment would increase, be different, etc.I checked my bank account this morning and $208.51 was deducted from my bank account instead of $25.00. I immediately called Sallie Mae and after 30 minutes of trying to speak to an actual person, was told that because my grace period was over my payment jumped from $25.00 to $208.51. WHAT??!? I understand once the grace period was over that payments should increase, however, I received NO notification of the increase from Sallie Mae and was quoted $25.00 by the customer service rep. If my grace period was over in 30 days from my phone conversation, the rep should have known that.Not only am I now overdrawn in my bank account, I have been on the phone all morning with Sallie Mae trying to get this resolved. I have been passed to multiple people in a call center who are clearly not located in the United States and all said, ""There's nothing we can do."" I am beyond frustrated."

The only reason I even went through Sallie Mae is my parents made ""too much"" for me to qualify for most grants. I have always paid my Sallie Mae loans on time and was paying interest on them while in school. I received loan repayment through a federal agency and first went to pay off ALL of my Sallie Mae loans in full.I went online to take myself off of automatic payments since I had a $0.00 balance on both loans. One of the loans was cosigned and it wouldn't let me take off automatic debit without my cosigner's PIN. I figure since I had a $0 balance, they would automatically stop taking money out of my account anyway... Wrong. They deducted like $127 from my checking account. I called outraged and demand that they put it back into my account immediately and informed them that was stealing. They essentially blamed me for not notifying them that I didn't owe them money and they would have continued to take money out had I not said anything. But it gets worse...It took them WEEKS to give me my money back. When I called (which was almost everyday), the people would never give me a callback number or a full name of a manager (I'm pretty sure there are not any managers). I asked repeatedly for a direct number to a manager and they stated, ""We don't have those numbers."" After many phone calls, I finally got a paper check from Sallie Mae for 8 dollars less than what they had taken out. I was told that it was for interest on my $0 balance... I have the statements from when they took it on my bank account. Unfortunately, when you pay off all your loans, the only thing you can get from their website is your tax information. Nothing else... You would have to call which we all know would be a joke."

His $10,000 loan issued in 2006 is now at over $25,000 and that is with me making regular monthly payments to the collection attorneys who filed a lawsuit. This is the biggest scam by the more horrific con artists that are allowed to do this legally. They should be shut down and all fees and interest should be abolished, and consumers who took out loans should be allowed to just pay off the original loan because of the heartache and stress these cons have caused to so many people."

I see ""adjustments"" without details or explanations on the online statements. Just want to get interest rate calculated and payment applied properly. There should be no reason for these unexplained non-detailed ""adjustments"" if they would just fix the error on the rate calculating. Still awaiting the research request results and found out today that if I call again, that a new research request would cancel previous research request and start over.

No one has answers regardless who you talk to. I have payments coming out of my account directly each month. Well a couple of months ago, I noticed they did not pull the payment but then proceeded the next month to take the following payment. This caused the next payment to go completely to interest. I then called Sallie Mae and spoke to several reps and no one could give answers as to why that payment was skipped. This sparked me to look at my account details. It seems as if there is a pattern of this and at this point I've had enough of them. Not to mention my balance never goes down. I wish I had the capability of paying it off or refinancing because of this. I don't understand why nothing further has been done with Sallie Mae and all their internal issues."

Upon completing the application, she was told to upload her drivers lic and social security card. After looking frantically for her SS card, I called my sibling who is in the same process. He informed me that the same thing was going on at his home (unable to locate card) and he contacted SALLIE MAE, who in turn told him that a PASSPORT could be used in place of the SS card. I contacted SALLIE MAE the following day and the customer service rep verified this. So now we complete her application, uploading the required and verified documentation. This was a week and a half ago. My daughter is getting nervous over her ""status"" and we contact SALLIE MAE today. The very nice customer service rep informs me that her documentation has not been received but she managed to ""push it through"" to received status. Great!!! Right??? Wrong... I am then informed that she needs to send her SS card... Really? A week and a half later? Do you know how LONG it takes??I explain that I was told that the passport is valid and could be used... That my nephew's loan from SALLIE MAE was approved with such documentation. No, they can not help her/me/us... Is this discrimination of some sort? We obviously need to get her SS card, but I am more upset that not one person at SALLIE MAE could tell me WHY this has happened... I am beyond upset and needless to say, my daughter's experience with going off to college is not going well as far as the SALLIE MAE front goes. You think anyone could give me a valid reason/answer?"

At the end of the day, the answer was that we have to again take a forbearance. Senator Kennedy addressed this issue years before his death.

There is always something wrong with my payments. I'm so sick and tired of dealing with this company.

2014-07-23 20:00:16,"San Jose, CA",Naomi,1.0,"In 2001, I applied for student loans from Sallie Mae through my school in order to pay tuition and living expenses. After 'graduation' in 2005 (I still need math and an internship/senior project to receive diploma), payments became due. I did not acquire a job that could support me and my student loans. I was harassed until I agreed to pay fees to keep the loans from defaulting, and they would not consolidate as they were private-student loans. Demanding payments of more than half my salary, the only options they gave were to pay fees to put loans aside for (I think it was 6-month increments) in order to keep loans from defaulting and ruining my credit. Nothing went to the principal or the interest. It was a fee. No offers of programs for relief and operators were harsh and unprofessional at times. One saying to me, ""It's not my fault you didn't get the job"", as I sobbed uncontrollably. Finally unable to even pay the fees and unwilling to speak to anyone from Sallie Mae, I slipped into a very debilitating depression. I filed for bankruptcy in 2006 but the lawyer was unwilling to touch Sallie Mae or offer any advice. When SLM bought my federal student loans from Citibank, I was enrolled in school half time in order to keep the loans from defaulting any further. Around 2010, SLM informed me that I owed a few thousand dollars due immediately because 'my grace period' of ten years was over and loans were now due even if I was enrolled in school. This is when a program was offered to halve my payments. After two years of making consistent payments, suddenly my payments are being made to federal loans and not private loans. No offers to enroll me into a program before the last had ended and payments expected to be made to both private and federal loans. I request payments that were made to federal loans be rerouted to private loans, and still no offer of a program to be enrolled in. So now, after continuous harassment for payments to be made and threat of being taken to collections, I am now enrolled in a program that makes automatic withdrawals from my bank account and SLM operator informs me my federal loans are over 300 payments behind and she cannot help me. How is this possible when federal loans were set aside because of payments being made in previous programs over the last two years and I was enrolled in school? I am sick of SLM. They offer no real visible goal of debt relief. I am currently seeking legal counsel and proactively researching about Sallie Mae."

I was told specifically by a CSR that I do not owe SALLIE MAE anything, my debt has been paid in full. This is causing more problems for my already damaged credit. I do not owe SALLIE MAE 21k so I do not owe the collection agency 21k especially for a debt that was originally 9k, that I was told was a debt paid in full and I no longer owe.

2014-07-20 17:03:13,"Appleton, WI",Jeanne,1.0,"I consolidated my student loans with Sallie Mae approximately 7 months ago. The original paperwork seemed correct. But ever since the loan origination date, it is clear that they either need new accountants or they are crooks. The first thing that I noticed was that the first two months my whole payment went toward interest - not one penny went toward the principal. That makes no sense if the loan has an end date and you are making payments prior to the due date. The third month, they applied money toward the principal and it almost looked like it ""caught up"" with what should have been applied toward the principal in the previous two months. Then the next two months, it went back to not applying anything toward the principal. Customer service, as most others here complain about, is a joke. I asked for a true breakdown of what part of the payment was applied toward principal and what was applied toward interest and they sent me the same paperwork they showed on the website. It was then that I decided I needed to get out of this ""relationship"" fast. So I found a new company to take over the loan. The amount that was sent to them was more than the current balance since I had to make another payment while waiting for the loan to finish. But, guess what... They just applied all of the extra toward interest and made the balance be zero. Great accounting... if you are a crook! I'm a math major so I have a little accounting sense too. I have calculated that they owe me over $500 at this point. You can be sure I am not going to let them get away with this without a fight. My advice to everyone is to stay away from Sallie Mae!!!"

The first time this happened, in March of 2014, I was so angry about them garnishing what little money I have to live on every month that I had to take a moment, go mad, and laugh and cry for a couple days (yes, this is it's very own step). I learn about TPDD (Total and Permanent Disability Discharge) of money owed and fill out the forms twice and immediately. I also have a signature secured and tracking number applied to both mailers sent out about a week apart. I am approved for the TPDD! Finally some good news, albeit news not received until July. Even MORE good news: I find out that I can be retroactively reimbursed for each month that I was garnished; there were five. So, if you're keeping score at home, I am owed $175. On July 11, 2014, I receive a check in the amount of $35 which Brings me to today where I have been transferred twelve (yes, 12) times to find out why I even received the check... let alone why it only seems to cover one garnishment. It's important to take a time-out for a second and explain that if you have ever been through anything like this with any other collection company, DO NOT deposit or CASH the check because that will be the END of that business relationship. Meaning, by depositing or cashing the check you AGREE that is the amount you are owed and NOTHING more. I just learned that there are THREE arms of disability garnishment: Sallie Mae, where the loans originate, Nel-Net, where the TPDD was approved and U.S. Department of Education, who actually conduct the garnishment on Sallie-Mae's behalf. It is important to note that NONE of these arms communicate with each other. Even now, I was just informed by USDEd that they show NO APPROVED TPDD, as it seems that their computers have no correspondence from Nel-Net. My experiences with USDEd was even more poor than the one star rating I gave Sallie Mae here; they are all very hostile and treat you with parental overtones that reflect a general disdain on their part for lenders who have defaulted. I FINALLY did get to the bottom of this and it turns out that when the TPDD was approved in June. It effectively wrote off the debt and transferred my account BACK to Sallie Mae, which also STOPPED the garnishment from USDEd after May. Sallie Mae still continued to garnish me, even in July but apparently wrote me a check for the garnishment which BEGAN with them in June. The check from Sallie Mae demonstrates that they too will no longer garnish me by August (hashtag #fingerscrossed). Summation: When USDEd gets official notification from Nel-Net (I'm guessing that they are the last to know), that the TPDD was in fact approved, that they MAY go back for March, April and May and retroactively reimburse me for those three months. Whether I get a reimbursement for July from Sallie Mae, I will not know for at least another month. Final Arguments: I am not a thief nor an irresponsible, habitual defaulter. I know this money was owed and I planned on paying it back. My chief complaint in all this is once again, bureaucracy must be served like the Vogons in Hitchhiker's Guide. What I mean is why doesn't the right arm know what the left (or center) arms are doing? Why does a garnishment happen to someone that falls BELOW the Very Poor (poverty) line? And was getting those million dollar bailouts, for which Chief Administrators then paid themselves gargantuan bonuses this difficult? I'm willing to bet $175 that it wasn't. I would not have known about the TPDD unless I did my own research and reading and endless hours of phone time with people working in loud and lousy call centers. By the way, they cannot hear you and you will not be able to hear them. One last important note: USDEd is with one branch of government and Social Security is with another. That is why they do not communicate with each other. If you have been approved for SS disability, that is NOT THE SAME as being approved for USDEd disability; even though they are the same thing with the same name for the same disability. It's a smart and screwed up system meant to protect the government from the very laws that they do not abide by... unless of course, you know how to file the right paperwork. Ignorance is bliss, until it's not."

After finding out that at 6.75% she's been paying 4 YEARS OF INTEREST, and nothing toward the principal. Then we find out that according to Sallie Mae's website she 19 payments PAST DUE!

2014-07-09 21:14:56,"Corpus Christi, TX",Toni,1.0,"I had been using Sallie Mae for my student loans from my Associate all the way through my Masters Degree programs. When I returned to school recently, Sallie Mae was not one of the choice lenders so I used another company. The other company offered me guidance on loan consolidation so I applied for a student loan consolidation with the new company. In the meantime, I made a payment on time to Sallie Mae. The student loan consolidation went through 5 days later, which created an overpayment of almost $900. When I inquired about the overpayment, Sallie Mae stated that the money would not be returned to me but that they would forward the overpayment to my new lender. More than 30 days passed and I sent a second inquiry. Sallie Mae informed me, in writing, that the payment would be forwarded to my new lender within 45-60 days of the consolidation and again asked for my patience. After the 60-day mark came and went, I sent a third inquiry. In response I received a letter stating that I needed to wait for processing time and to be patient. At that point I finally filed complaint with 2 different companies regarding Sallie Mae's refusal to return or forward the overpayment. When 90 days had passed since the consolidation, I received a string of email correspondence letters from Sallie Mae stating that my loans had all been paid in full. At that time, I found out that my online account access was locked so I had to call to inquire about the overpayment. A ""supervisor"" proceeded to tell me that the payment was supposedly forwarded to the new lender. He gave me no good reason as to why the money could not have been refunded to me, and he refused to tell me why it took 90 days and a complaint with BBB for any action on the account. The ""supervisor"" also refused to offer any explanation as to why I was told in writing that the process would take only 45-60 days, and he refused to transfer me to anyone who was willing and able to provide an explanation. Bottom line: if you want a student loan, I do not recommend Sallie Mae. This was not the first time I have been lied to in writing by them, but it was by far the worst. They took my money and refused to return it in a timely manner. They refused to stand by their written promises, and they refused to offer any good explanation as to why it took so long to refund or forward the money. As of this review, 2 days have passed since the money was supposedly forwarded to my new lender but there is no record of the new lender receiving the payment. There are many competitive choices with regard to student loans. Do your research and give a lot of thought to the lender you want to be dealing with for the next several years of your life."

I have been faithfully paying on my loan since 2007, these people have been nothing but a nightmare over the years. In May, I requested a temporary interest only repayment plan (I got their terrible customer service who I can barely understand of course) and they said they needed to review my account since I had already used an interest only plan once before.After reviewing my account the guy said they would grant me another and proceeded to tell me what my new payment would be, how much it would go up after the plan ended etc. So next my online account showed nothing due. I made a payment anyways, so as not to be late. Then in June the amount due wasn't correct but I paid it, thinking maybe it takes a month for them to get it updated. July, my payment due was the full amount. WTF???!! So I call the idiots today and they tell me that there was never a request put in for interest only payments, and I never qualified!!?? SO I WAS LIED TO?!! Are you freaking serious?! I bet those ""phone"" records they keep are ""missing"" the day I called and was given an interest only plan. Yeah, the only option they said I could take was the lowering my interest in the collections department, BUT MY LOAN IS CURRENT!"

Fell 50 points since January and their statements never match my bank withdrawal statements.Be careful. They will overpay one loan and let another run consistently past due so they can collect late fess. I finally paid $1200 yesterday just to try and see if my loans will show up as current and up to date. They will reverse your payments in order to charge late fees if you do pay online.

I have had family members and even those on my road that I live getting calls from them that I know for a fact was not put on my so-called application as references to get in touch with me while I am getting calls of three or more a day that are nothing more than automated messages that want me to call back at a long distance number to settle the issues. They have been caught in my opinion as 'Phone Phishing' telling these people that I have turned their numbers in. One was my ex-wife whom still has the same last name and told them to stop calling her as she does not speak to me that often and does not wish to know my business as they are telling her flat out that I owe them money without saying the exact words. To me 'this is about a personal business matter...' is as telling as actually saying 'hey this person owes us money and we want it paid.' They continue to call my home phone but no live person ever answers me and yet they call my family and neighbors and speak with them saying they are unable to call me when I have on countless occasions gave them my number and even went as far as telling them in both verbal and written form that I am fully disabled and wish to speak to a live person and will not call long distance to speak to them. I have grown so angry with their practices that I have resorted to searching for options as they do not even send me mail. It's all harassment of other people and myself."

His grandma was a co-signer on his student loans that total about $35,000. The estate has pushed my husband to get her off the loan, so he sent in all the documents trying to do so. After speaking with a number of people Sallie Mae stated they would look into the matter and get her name off. After weeks of speaking with them, they put his claim to some other department to ""review"" it. After a few days, Sallie Mae came back with the choice that they wanted the loan paid in full and planned to go after the estate. My husband is still getting his masters degree and we make out interest payments every month. We have yet to go to court on the matter. My husband is still in school and is not even required to make the payments yet and Sallie Mae has already made the choice that they plan to go after her estate. They are not allowed to call it ""auto default"" anymore but that's pretty much what they are doing. I have done a lot of research on this matter and have found that this is happening to lots of people right know. If a co-signer dies or files bankruptcy they ask for the payment in full. The worst part about it all is that my husband found another co-signer and called to try and start the process. Sallie Mae said ""no"" and they still plan to place to go after the estate. This is a soul-less company. Like I said she raised my husband and was his main support system growing up. He not only is grieving the death of his grandma but is also stressed over student loan payments and money we shouldn't even have to be making. I can never say enough how HORRIBLE this company is. This will all eventually pile up on Sallie Mae and their day in court will be coming, but until then thousands of people are suffering."

I have noticed that about every 10 days, the balance on my husband's loan will increase by random amounts. In the past 11 days, it has increased twice by almost $40. We have never missed or been late on a payment. We are making the minimum payment, so WHY is our balance increasing? Is this happening to anyone else? Is there an interest rate thing I am not understanding? Three calls have been made to Sallie Mae and no one can give us an answer that makes sense. They repeatedly tell us that the interest accrues daily... yes we understand that. They refused to give us a printout of our balance history over the past 4 years, saying they don't keep those records. Maybe there is something I am not understanding, but it seems to be common sense that if we are making all of our payments on time, our balance should not be increasing."

Everything from customer service to payment options there is ABSOLUTELY nothing positive to say about the company as a whole. The only positive that came out of it was my funding for obtaining my degree. Every time I call I get transferred at least 3 times, I've been hung up on countless times and received no call back when they ensure they will. The other day I called because I had noticed my payment had gone up. I received no call, no letter, only an email stating that they had posted a new document to my online account, which no one can seem to unlock in the technical department so I can't even view the documents. That is just the tip of the iceberg. The biggest slap in the face is during that same call I tried to ask if there was a way I could make a payment but I couldn't pay the obscene increase that they were tacking on to me. I kept telling her I wanted to make a payment but needed a little help to get it down and keep it around the $350 they had promised me prior. She kept telling me over and over there was nothing she could do for me. I told her I had been helped before when I was laid off and that they accepted not even $100 a month because I was in a financial bind but was still willing to pay something. She said the only, the ONLY, way they would help me was for me to go into default and then they would help me. So I even repeated it to her, ""So you're only willing to help me if I ruin my credit score and go into default causing my co-signer to affected as well?"" Her response was, ""Yes, we can only help if you are in default."" I'm willing to give you money, $350 to be exact, and you won't take it because it's not the full amount, which was different than what I had agreed on the previous month! I've never heard such ** excuses on top of excuses from customer service. They say they record their conversations; I'd really like access to those so I could throw back in their face what they agree upon and then how they lie to you the next time you've called because you've caught their lie when you look at your bank account. I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone. Don't get a loan from them and don't even go to their website; it's full of nothing but crushed dreams and hopes. Stay clear of them and go ANYWHERE else to get a student loan. Trust me, if I could even save one person from the heartache this review will be worth it."

I am fortunate enough to have a good job, if not I would have been unable to make the $1620 a month payments Sallie Mae demanded. I finally thought the worst was over when Citizens Bank allowed me to consolidate my private loans dropping my interest rate 3% and my payments $200 a month. Unfortunately, due to the timing, Sallie Mae wound up owing me over $900. It is now 3 months later &amp; almost $600 has not been paid back to me yet. Each time I call, I am told completely different things, forced to wait a full month for a new check, which I recently discovered they have at some times never even sent and treat me as if I am unreasonable for wanting the money they owe me.

There is absolutely NOTHING which has changed in my account. I have never been late on any payment (of significance), and my credit rating has been over a 700. And for some mysterious reason, after it took them 12 days to process my online payment, same account/same routing number/same info which hasn't changed in 4 years, here I am receiving ""the delinquent"" notice. I've saved my paper trail, screen-captured my relevant screens, etc. from the online site. I have yet to butt-heads with their staff by phone, but I did send a rather civil and cold email to whoever will peruse such things on their end of the Ether-net.I have some major issues with Sallie Mae not being able to apply online payments correctly, and I'm wondering if they can be gotten on a fraudulent business practices, or even malfeasance. A company who secures your information does not just ""send or apply the payment"" mistakenly ""to the wrong routing number"" or a checking account.

We would rank in the lower end of the middle class income range. Again, like so many others, we manage our money well enough to have a decent credit rating. That's where Sallie Mae gets you. We didn't want to deny our daughter the education so we signed the co-sign line not fully understanding how expensive the loans were. EXAMPLE: we pay $500.00 every month against these loans. In December 2013, the principal balance on 3 loans (combined) was $33000.00. It has been 6 months since, that is $3000.00 paid out toward these loans but the only dent made against them totaled $1234.00! That's right, $1766.00 that Sallie Mae will use to keep their lights on and stock-holders smiling during these last 6 months (as of June 2014). I understand that money costs money, but essentially, at this point of these three student loans, the interest rate is 59% monthly. To put one positive spin on this, the daughter for whom these loans were made, (part of the entitlement generation) may have to pay for some of her own education should these loans outlive my wife and myself."

My student loans are now out of their deferment status and I am now making payments. As we all know the Sallie Mae website is a series of riddles so I wanted to make my payments easier to understand and consolidate everything for one easy automatic payment. The process was going smooth, I received a letter with all the loans to be consolidated and all looked good. My balance was $49k and I received a letter with my new payment and it was a little lower than before because of the new consolidated interest rate. (Awesome!) I went to set up automatic payments the other day and my 49k has turned into $90k over night!!! The new payment online is now $250 more than the original unconsolidated payment!!! How does this happen? Are there astronomical fees for consolidation? Has someone made a mistake? Is there something illegal going on? My interest rate only went down and no one can seem to answer my questions on how the balance doubled. I am fortunate to have a good job and have the ability to pay my loans, however I will only pay the amount that I borrowed plus interest. I will not pay a fictitious number that seems to be illegal. If this situation is not corrected along with other implications that may result in this error, I have an attorney is on stand by. Moral of the story, DO NOT use Sallie Mae for any financial services. DO NOT fall into the trap of flexible loan payments or options.

In turn she goes without paying her other bills and she's been going without food.

I explained to her the situation and detail and her response was to set up a credit card payment or debit card payment today for nearly $500.00 and then schedule automatic payments monthly. I again explained the fact that this 91 year old woman does not have the money to pay this bill for her grandson and she needs a deferment. I was told that cost $100.00 and would only cover this month...She paid $200.00 this month, when the monthly payment is for $86.00! I again stated she does not have the money to keep paying this bill and she shouldn't be threatened and I was told she owes the money and needs to set up a payment today on the phone before we hang up! Again, she paid $200.00 a week ago! She cannot pay her electric bill now and she has no food, yet they want her to pay more today!The loan balance is around 1,500.00, yet they're acting like it's thousands!

Sometimes they would call and I would not answer, they would call back immediately.Finally I called back to see what the problem was. They said the loans are in default and they wanted my credit card number to get them current. I asked if they called the student and they said yes, and their was no response. I called the student and was told they never received any calls from Sallie Mae. Since I am a joint on the students bank account I could see $1000 per month going to Sallie Mae which is more than the minimum payment. I called SM back and they said they have no record of payments. They said I needed to speak with the Department of Education and they transferred me. Finally I got a nice person who was willing to help.

Mad that I was misled again about who I was communication with, I asked for the person I spoke with, who was so helpful and they said they had nobody there by that name and did not know who it was. I said I had not received the accounting of the loans and they said it was sent and to give it more time. Another week and I called back. I asked to resend it, they said no. I asked them to fax it, they said no. I asked if they could give me the info over the phone, they said no.Desperate to resolve this, I asked if I could fax to them printouts from the bank account showing the $ going to Sallie Mae. They gave me a fax # and I have a confirmation that it went through. A week late,r I called to follow up and they said they did not receive it. They said I used the wrong fax # and gave me another. I faxed again and have a confirmation it went through. I called a few days later and they said they never received it. I faxed a third time with the same results.The student was able to finally get through and they set her up on auto payments to resolve the issue. 5 months later I get a letter from the school, this time saying the loans are in default. SM did auto pay for 3 months and then stopped for no apparent reason and put the loans back in default and are sending a collection after us. There is always plenty of money in the account and we have never had a NSF on the account. Needless to say, both our credit scores are ruined. The issue is still not resolved and perhaps won't be until whoever Sallie Mae is paying in the government that allows them to continue to operate like this is removed. We tried to find other servicers but it has been impossible.The schools are pissing me off too as it seems they sell a bill of goods ( our student went to a well known and respected expensive private school despite of us offering to fully pay for a state school), and don't back it up with jobs. It's as if they have their money, the students are gone and they can sell the next ones in. Yet they continuously send me requests for donations to their foundation. This has been going on for over 2 years. It's taken a toll on me and we're not sure where to go with Sallie Mae. I wish I could give them negative stars."
2014-06-06 21:33:44,"Baltimore, MD",Rebecca,1.0,"On three occasions, I made payments over the phone to my Sallie Mae account. I was paying off the Unsubsidized loans I had, while the rest were in deferment during medical school. I was told that I could apply payments to pay off, in full, only the unsubsidized loan if that is what I requested. Each time, when I checked the status of my payment, it was split between the subsidized and unsubsidized loans. By the time I called Sallie Mae about this, I was told they couldn't reallocate the payment because then the other loan would be delinquent (though, I'm not sure how because I'm in school and they were all deferred). I also had continued to accrue interest on the unsubsidized loan in this time. I spoke with a supervisor who told me the same thing, and offered no solutions, on any of the three occasions.I have spoken with financial advisors who recommended making payments to the unsubsidized loans, and they all said that payments should be made over the phone so you can request the payment is allocated to only the one you specify. Sallie Mae tried to tell me they don't normally put payments towards only one loan. When I asked them if I was the first person to ever request this, and if they had done it in the past, the supervisor responded that I was not the first person and they were able to do this. Unfortunately, I had several very incompetent people ""helping"" me.After spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on college and medical school, I can say I would never recommend Sallie Mae to anyone for loan consolidation. Their customer service is horrible. I have paid off all of my loans, and have no one there to thank. I wanted to pass this on to anyone else with a lot of school debt. Research your lenders in depth!"
2014-06-03 22:45:26,"Fukuoka, Other",J,1.0,"At Sallie Mae they may make major changes on your account and wont take the time to notify the borrower. They also completely ignore information you send to them, as with a letter telling them you will be moving abroad for one year to take part in a volunteer program and requesting a deferment. It happened to me. When this happened I had already graduated from a 4 year university and was about to begin payments as it had almost been 6 months. As I was planning to go abroad for one year to take part in a volunteer program, I sent them a letter telling that and also asking for a one year deferment. On the phone call I made they sure enough confirmed the deferment for one year so I thought I would be fine as I would be back in one year. Little did I know that they had made major changes on my account that had nothing to do with the letter I sent them. What happened was I had taken a summer school class at a community college that summer I was planning to leave the country. So at Sallie Mae they had completely change everything, specifically changing my status to being a student that will be graduating all over again and this time from a community college; hence the deferment they granted, completely unrelated to my real plans and not the deferment I was asking for in the letter sent - the letter they chose to completely ignore. So I go abroad for one year just to come back to a tarnished credit record. Be careful if you have to use Sallie Mae as a lender. They will make major changes on your account without notification or verification, and they will completely ignore letters you send to them, even letters with vital information telling them you are moving to another country and need a deferment. In trying to get this corrected I also ran into some real scum. Some workers at Sallie Mae are real scum and it is probably because of them that this lending company has a bad rap. They are careless, unethical and wont really want to help you. Best not to deal with this unprofessional, disorganized and flaw-filled company, so if at all possible I would advise any potential borrower to borrow from a different lending company."

Years later, I ask Sallie Mae to reverse the positions so I could get the person who was listed as the signer off the loan and they refuse to do so. I have paid on the loan for 6 years and not missed a payment. I am only trying to release the person who helped me so the loan is not on their credit report anymore."

I wasn't expecting to pay $180 per month... paid a couple of days late and got stuck with an addition $70 dollars in debt. At this point, I got nothing from Stevens ** or my college experience... I try and pay back everything I owe even if I was ripped off, but this? It's questionable practice. I keep up on my bills as well. Reading some of the other reviews on Sallie Mae, sounds like a loan shark company that does nothing but get the records messed up... Just me, but outsourcing, one foot doesn't see the other foot...

2014-05-28 01:19:06,"San Antonio, TX",James,1.0,"I had a $43K of consolidated loans. My bank and TGSL were suppose to be taking their money out of my acct because I was suppose to deploy. However, when I got back from training, I had a letter from TGSL saying my loans (which were probably less than $40K by now) had been put in default due to nonpayment and sent to a collection agency ACT (which a supervisor told me TGSL and Sallie Mae owned ACT, that's why they put so many loans into default). I had even spoken with the ombudsman at TGSL and she was suppose to call me if anything went wrong, as was the bank. Well, my less than $40k loan, jumped to over $97K and my 2.7% interest jumped to 27%! After I picked myself up off of the floor, I called the collection agency, bank and everyone else I could think of. I continued to pay on my loans while they were at the collection agency.At the same time, I challenged them daily/weekly. After about a year, TGSL agreed they had made a mistake and took my loans out of default. Well, all but a $2,500 Sallie Mae loan that was over 25yrs old, that I had paid on and worked for AmeriCorp to pay off, which is another ripoff, they never applied the amt to the loan, plus they farmed me out to another company for more money. Anyway, Sallie Mae refused to take the $2,500 out of default, even though it had been consolidated with the others, and they jumped it to $25K and sold it to TGSL!!! Scam, scam, scam. After months of trying to work with the ombudsman at TGSL, she told me the only way to bring it back down was to go consolidate it with the other loans at the Wm. D. Ford website. So, I did. Then a week later I get a letter from Sallie Mae saying they now have all of my loans and the amount is now over $87K!! I've asked what happened to the money I paid on the loans, over $10K. They applied it to the interest when it was wrongly put into default, They never reversed the amount because of the mistake on their part and kept the amt from the 27% interest! I'm still fighting them. I've tried hiring an attorney to see about bankruptcy, to no avail. I'm looking for any atty that will help me possibly sue the bank for their mistake as well. This has caused me such stress, they need to be sued big time!One reason they get away with there low-life tactics, is that a lot of politicians have a lot of stock with Sallie Mae, especially the speaker of the house, John Boehner!!! Hate the guy!! If anyone knows an atty that can help, please post his name. We, the People need to peacefully protest on the WH and or our state capital and or local city hall to let them know we want justice and Sallie Mae to be shut down. I tried starting a petition on Change.org about Sallie Mae and to force some oversight, plus student loans / Sallie Mae were part of the subprime mortgage scam that ruined millions of people. Yet, Obama is helping those who should never have taken out a mortgage and forgiving their loan. WHY WON'T THEY DO IT FOR STUDENT LOANS?? PRESIDENT OBAMA... PLEASE HELP!"

I do think it's ridiculous that there is up to 19% interest on some of my loans, but I pay them monthly by working two jobs. Last month, I lost one of my jobs and it made it difficult to make all my payments. I called Sallie Mae asking to postpone the payment until the end of the month, when I received my second paycheck. It still went out on the day it was scheduled. When I called my bank to put a stop payment on it, they said there was nothing they could do. When I called Sallie Mae and told them that my bank said the only way to stop the check from going out was to dispute it as an unauthorized charge, the lady on the phone became extremely rude and condescending. This was what my bank had recommended, not trying to get out of paying my loans. After minutes of her lecturing me, and being a rude person, she told me to have a nice day and hung up. None of these people know what they are doing. They have no idea how to talk to people and they are extremely RUDE. This company is financially ruining an entire generation and we are paying them to do it."

I set up the online payment system and my payment has bounced for 5 months straight so far even though I have sufficient funds in my account. When I called Sallie Mae to see what the problem was they insisted that it wasn't on their end and that I had to take it up with my bank. I finally thought I figured out the problem and I paid my balance, but the next month it happened again! I was annoyed so I called in and set up auto pay with a rep thinking the problem would be fixed.Next month rolled around and I get another angry and persistent call from a Sallie Mae rep saying my payment was late and barking at me to pay it. When I tried to fix my account info once again I was told that they couldn't help me and to take it up with my bank. Worst service ever. I am so fed up with this.... they keep knocking me for being late on my payments even though it is on their end, not mine and they can clearly tell that I am trying to pay each month. I am so over this. DO NOT use Sallie Mae for your loans. Extremely frustrating and big waste of my time. Save yourself. I would never want anyone else to have to go through this."

I spoke to two Sallie Mae representatives who both assured me that the additional amount I requested will be debited from my account each month. I received a letter stating that the amount that would be debited from my account is the minimum payment due. I called customer service just to be told that it is IMPOSSIBLE for them to debit more than the minimum payment. I was furious especially since the man who told me this was ALSO one of the representatives who lied to me! Of course instead of letting me stay on the line to answer the 4 question survey, he hangs up. Sallie Mae is the worst. If you can, please get your student loans from the government.

I have fought with Department of Ed for 7 years on this loan after my vehicle accident and became totally disabled. I only made $700+ per month to support my family. If you're reading this, go private and not through these morons. They don't care about people or our great veterans. I'm blessed that this company got fined $97 million for messing with the people that protect our country.

Every other month, like clockwork, I get a call from Sallie Mae collections saying I missed a payment and am in arrears. The first time I thought ok maybe I did, sent the $25 and an additional $25. I still get the calls from a harassing collections person and when I escalated to a manager the last 2 times, they both say, ""Well, it looks like you're correct and current but need to research it."" I never get a call back and then like clockwork 2 months later same thing. Third time happened today. When I ask Greg, a manager, he says, ""Oh, I agree with you. I have to research it but looks like your forward payments were never applied to the account."" When I ask what I can do to correct this once and for all, they want to make automatic withdrawals. Now why in the world would I do that when they can't prove to get the account balance correct? When I ask how I can escalate to an Ombudsman to get this corrected, they say I cannot. Only they can internally (what is the point of an Ombudsman if you cannot reach them?). Never in my entire 45 years of adult life have I dealt with people so unwilling to help. When I asked Greg if they could provide the results of the research, which mind you they have promised to do twice now, in writing, he tells me he does not think he can because it's not company policy. These folks are terrible at reconciling an issue, unwilling to provide any responsibility in writing and basically just a harassing organization that is predatory in nature. Please people read all these complaints and look elsewhere for your student loans. I sure wish my daughter did."

When I met with the college financial person, I was told, along with all the other students, that my loan will be satisfied 10 years post graduation. My loans were consolidated at a 3.85% rate (so I thought). I took a payment deferment about 3-4 years after I graduated for 2 years, if that, due to hardships. I was told that the payments will be slightly higher once reinstated. Naturally, the loan payments started up again, and 14 years later, I come to find out I still have $15,000 freaking dollars left to pay! And that they had me on ""interest only"" payments for 4 years. So according to Sallie Mae, my $24,000 student loan will be satisfied May 2024! So Sallie Mae is making me pay for 24 years!

2014-05-08 20:15:27,"Peculiar, MO",Leanna,1.0,"Sallie Mae has haunted my family for the past two years. My mom is a co-signer for my sister but my sister decided to stop paying her loans. Eventually, Sallie Mae started harassing my mom at work and at home via phone and mail. My mom paid what was due at the time and caught my sister's payments up. However, my sister didn't start paying after that so they started harassing my mom again in January 2014. My mom had just gotten over cancer and we had medical bills out the wazoo (I had to leave my dorm and move home to help/save money). She tried to explain to Sallie Mae that she couldn't pay the lump sum they were asking for ($30,000) and that she would try to get her daughter (my sister) to pay her loans. Fast forward to now and my sister is finally current on her loans and she has a nice repayment agreement with them, but now I'm trying to get a loan for my LAST semester of college but it was denied because of my sister's stupidity and how she messed up my mom's credit (that's not why I'm mad). I'm angry with Sallie Mae because today we filed an appeal with the Dept of Education in order to get my loan denial reversed - they informed us that we would need documentation that the Sallie Mae account was current. We called Sallie Mae and were transferred FIVE times until we reached the right person, and then we couldn't even understand her because it sounded like they had the phone half-way down her throat. When we tried to explain to her what was going on, she kept interrupting and was extremely rude. We told her that we needed a letter stating the account was current and that we could give them a fax number to fax it to the DoE. She said that the request for the letter would take 7 TO 14 BUSINESS DAYS and then because it's a manual letter, it can't be faxed and it would take another 7 TO 14 BUSINESS DAYS just to send via mail. Needless to say, I am extremely upset because all we needed was something saying the account is caught up, and we have 30 days to get this appeal processed because my summer classes start June 9. Sallie Mae is worthless and has screwed too many people over in the past (and currently). They need to be stopped. They're just a money-hungry corporation that feeds on the pennies and dimes that they can squeeze out of middle class America until they're all in poverty."

I only found out when I called to check on it. On the phone, I was given the option to put my loan into forbearance. My payment for the forbearance cleared on April 27, however, my forbearance request still hasn't processed.It's May 8 and Sallie Mae states that the request can take up to 5 business days. It's been about 12 business days when I originally made the request and 8 business days since my payment cleared. I called again today and was asked all the same questions as before. While on the phone, I was disconnected 2x. There is still a chance Sallie Mae can deny my request. This company is a huge joke!"

I have no problems talking to someone in collections (although they are a bit overly aggressive in my opinion, with threats, etc). However what angers me more is their broken auto dialer.

This will continue multiple times throughout the day for the next week or so. Around mid-month - Call with automated message that takes you through several prompts. Then around the same day, finally a message to hold on the line for a representative (wait, didn't you call me?). Finally, by the time I do speak with someone, I am livid over their harassing system of calls. Then the process starts over about 3 days later. Don't misunderstand me. I know the payments need to get ""caught up"" and I know we wouldn't be getting the calls if they were. However the collection system is broken and they refuse to fix it after repeated complaints. Isn't calling someone over and over and hanging up harassment?"

I had a low interest loan and a higher interest parent plus loan taken out by my mom so I could finish school. I filled out the application to consolidate these two loans. When I got the response, my low interest loan was bought by Sallie Mae but not the other. I called the company to ask why the other was not. They informed me that since the loan was in my mother's name and not mine, they could not include that loan. I told them to cancel the whole thing since it wouldn't consolidate anything which was the whole point, just change the interest rate to something higher. They said that was impossible since they already bought the loan. Now, in my older years, I would have stopped it there since they should have been obligated to contact me before proceeding since there was a discrepancy in the application. Fast forward 14 years (I was a teacher, so minimum payments were all I could do), I am still paying on this loan with an interest rate higher than I have ever seen before or since. I didn't understand interest rates then but I sure do now. In addition to this, they do not (unlike most student loan lenders) allow you to check a box when you are paying each month to give extra to the principal. This is one of the companies that got bailed out in the bank crisis, yet, I am still being taken advantage of by them."

Within two hours the president of the company I work for was called. They proceeded to contact me during a meeting, called me out of the meeting to tell me that someone called and that I was to contact this number immediately otherwise they would take legal action. At this point I am in a state of shock not knowing what is going on.I proceeded to call the number, identify myself with a number supplied to me and I asked what was this call in reference to and this is when I found out that it was about a student loan I had cosigned a few years back and the person responsible was not paying the due amount. Instead this person was paying a minimum amount (what this person consider they could afford) and I was told that I was responsible for this loan because the person failed to pay. I asked if they try to contact the person and the reply was that because they did not paid I was responsible and that I should pay the amount of $20,000. Immediately I said that I did not have that kind of money. The person in the other end said that I did and that I could also pay with a credit card. I reply that their request was ridiculous and that I would call back. Someone by the name of Tim ** continuously call my work number and leave threatening and very intimidating messages in my work voice mail. I called them back, spoke to someone by the name of David because the person Tim ** was not available. I specifically said that the message was for Tim **, that a lawyer will be contacting them within a week or two, to please not to call my work number again because this intimidating messages and the way they contacted me was affecting me my work performance. This message did not stop Mr. **. He has left me multiple messages that legal action, such a pay garnish, will take place... my work place will be told (already done). There is no words that could explain how ashamed, embarrassed and nervous I was, needless to try to explain how it was already affecting my work performance and how I perceived how people were looking at me. This entity or company never try to reach out to me any other way before. I never received a letter or any other type of communication prior to this incident. I am certain if they were able to find my work information they also had the ability to find my resident address, phone number, cell phone etcetera.As a consumer I must have some right to protect me from being harassed like this especially when I was never contacted before in any way. While I do understand I have certain responsibilities as a co-signer, companies like this should make an effort to pursue the original loan owner and make attempt before proceeding to the next step. I truly believe the way they are proceeding is unorthodox, as I also know that I have certain responsibilities as a cosigner, I have right as a consumer. I take my responsibilities and work very serious. I hope you can assist or intervene in this matter. Companies and entities should have work ethics. I understand everyone needs a job including Mr. **. The same way I know they have been trained certain way to achieve the best work performance, some individual like him should be re-trained. I also know that this has merits for a class action for fairness. I kindly hope you can assist me in this matter or point me in the right direction."

PNC reversed the debit with no questions asked. Sallie Mae did this 2 more times in 2 days. When I went to PNC the 3rd day we decided to close all of our accounts and start over.Fast forward 11 months to yesterday. My husband called me to tell me that the ACH payment we send to Sallie Mae through PNC was misapplied and we owed a late fee. The process worked perfectly for 11 months then all of a sudden there is an error on an automatic payment.

I originally borrowed $40,000. at 9% interest, thinking I could pay it off in installments. My loan balance due is now at $175,434 at a daily interest rate of 19.15540% with $33,000 going to collection costs and I have paid $60,079.18 in interest. I had read the literature that stated one could only go into forbearance if disabled, etc., which I wasn't. Many years later, I heard from an attorney that I could have used forbearance. Years ago, as a single mom, someone approached me, on the phone, trying to ""cut a deal"" for $650. per month, my rent at that time, making me and my children homeless - not an option. So, I had the same nightmare as described by many. They have retained my tax refunds for many years and garnished my paycheck. Now I heard read, online, that they may freeze my checking account, by others, and that it's usually a surprise. If so, how so, since it's the account where my check goes to pay bills, the check they're already garnishing. Make sure you pay attention to your bank accounts!"

I had originally asked for $8000 and Fall 2013 I received half of the amount expecting $4000 for Spring 2014. I had to ask for a school emergency loan to pay my classes for Spring having those $4000 on hold. I was asked to resign my work study job due to excessive funds but I did not qualify for financial aid to begin with which was why I had asked for the loan. So I am now jobless and having to give payments on money I have not received. Sallie Mae reps tell me to speak to my college and college to speak to Sallie Mae. I am lost, frustrated and stressed out! Then Sallie Mae reps tell me to call the Department of Education because it is out of their hands! HELLO, it's your money. How come you can't just ask for it back!"

I do not know why the government uses our tax dollars to give Sallie Mae to loan to us and they are not interested in deferment like the government Direct Student Loan. In order to get deferment, they charge you over a hundred dollars for 3 months which makes no sense because you put on your credit card because you're not working and can't pay the bill and they keep doing that but remember that these payments are not going towards your bills. So it is defeating the purpose but good for them because they're in it for profit unlike the government Direct Student Loan who is more empathetic in understanding the economic situation. And the kids are overburdened with student loans and no jobs. See why they should not be giving our tax dollars to Sallie Mae to loan to us. Let us do away with the middle man and deal with Direct Student Loan of the government which is less stress."

We agreed on a set amount and I was approved for the full amount requested.. right around $52,000. I was to receive quarterly payments from the loan.. all was well until 3/4 of the way through college when I was told, ""sorry ... yeah we aren't going to give you 52,000.. your capped out at 42,000"".. I was dumbfounded.. since we already signed the paperwork and all was agreed upon.. Guess not.. after 100's of calls and managers.. I was basically screwed..Luckily I had saved the living expenses extra money and was working a full time job plus going to school 14 hrs a day.. aka barely graduated top 2 of my class.. and lived on $40 week until I finished..Thanks Sallie Mae..Oh but we have just begun this wonderful story..After school they wanted 650 a month.. we agreed upon a different number which was 350 a month.. great after multiple calls I was told ""no worries we can do a forbearance/deferment"".. ""it will give you a break.. until you land that ""Dream"" job and can afford 650 a month.."" With no real options, and working 2 crappy full time jobs after I graduated.. I followed along like a dumb little lemming..Once this ""grace/Forbearance/Deferment"" period was over my payments had jumped to $1000 a month and my total balance went from $52,000 to $72,000..(nice interest amount over a year don't you think?)Almost had a heart attack at 25.. the walls were closing in.. quick again being a dumb lemming I had to move back home and ""buckled down""... Off went my $1000 a month for a year and a half.. finally one day I figured I'd call Sallie Mae and inquire about this letter I received that said my remaining balance was 82,000..2nd almost heart attack...300+ calls multiple managers and nobody could figure this one out.. They saw my payments.. and yet the balance just rose.. Not to mention it was one snotty customer service rep after another..after another.. seemed to get progressively worse..I did not want to default on my loans.. that's not the type of person I am.. but thanks to these wonderfully horrible people.. I really had no choice..Called attorney's.. no luck your boned.. tried to lower payments.. no luck w/o co-signer...Literally was as depressed as a young man could be.. what a WONDERFUL way to start out huh?I remember my ignorance as a younger man sitting in the loan office and words whizzing past my head in a cloud of smoke.. because ""I'm going to college.. I'm going to make something of myself!!""Unfortunately I chose the WRONG lender... and was oblivious to the scams they were running..uh.. deep breath..Screw it.. you can have 300 a month or nothing.. they chose nothing.. payments stopped (since they didn't seem to be applying to the loan anyway).. Credit Destroyed..Fast forward..7 years..No tax returns.. irritating but whatever..Started to get wage garnishments.. didn't like that.. went and talked to the local social security office, because that's where my money was ""going"" after it was taken out..Talked with them for a hour that arranged manageable payments ($400 a month) that actually apply to my loan!! amazing.. Sallie Mae got dropped from the loop and they just sent it on down the creditor line until I finally found someone not crooked..Moral of the story.. Worst experience of my life.. If you are thinking of using sallie mae for ANYTHING... Stop.. STOP... go punch yourself in the face until that idea pops out and then you can find something else... seriously don't let your kids get screwed.. This whole fiasco put me back 4 years career wise..

Nothing I do or have done will change and I will be stuck with this loan at 6.42% for the rest of my life! Sallie Mae is allowed to rip people off by legally over-charging interest, which turns into compound interest so we get financially screwed - legally. Please anyone that has advice, please help!"

I have since been trying to get an itemized statement showing how all my money was applied since apparently the amount the escrow sent did not pay off the loan/s.. I have been unsuccessful on getting that.. they say log online and that information only goes back one year.. They issued the same account number in 2009 when I took out a parent plus loan for my daughter...I was very lucky that I still have all my bank statements.. In 2010 I printed out from their website after paying my daughters loan showing nothing on any line, now they have added only the loan and total payment dollars but not amount sent and have also put it on my credit report, however, under student loans there is no amount.. They are back pedaling to try to justify the amount they say I owe which was 245.00 and now with interest and late fees is 350.00.. I get at least 5 calls a day from student assistance aka Sallie Mae and have sent a letter to Dept of Education Ombudsman with no reply... all I am asking is paperwork showing how my money was applied and they cannot produce it.. I have considered taking them to small claims court but it's the government and how much luck will I have with that...

But not ONE soul mentioned this to me before, when I told them that my primary goal was to have my co-signor removed. 24 months and higher payments later, I was told I have to be a US citizen. Though they took it back when I pointed out their own rules and requirements to them that clearly state being a permanent resident is enough. Now they claim my credit which is in the high 700's is not good enough. And I would like to stress on both time I talked to dozens of associates and managers (especially after the first disappointment) and no one sees an issue but when I made that request SUDDENLY EVERY associate tells me I have to be a US citizen as if they were trained to say that.

I wanted to take my son's loans out of deferment and start his payments while he is in college so when he graduates he won't be buried for the next 30 years in loans. I tried setting up auto debit on their website and couldn't initially since the loans are in deferment. I called Sallie Mae in October trying to get this all started and the first auto debit payment didn't start until February. At every turn they try to force your loans back into deferment and at one point a young lady argued with me telling me I needed to leave them in deferment since I didn't ""have"" to make payments yet. Sallie Mae should not be in the credit advice business and stop bullying these kids into placing all loans in deferment. The loans should be at least partiality immediately and only go into deferment at the request of the customer. And finally auto payments should not take weeks or months but should be done in minutes online. Sallie Mae is an example of a government program run wild and not in any way consumer based. The government needs to remove the levels of stupidity and run Sallie Mae more like a business."
2014-02-26 01:19:32,"Mountain Lakes, NJ",Justine,1.0,"I graduated from a four year college in 2009 being about $75,000 in debt. In December of 2009 I got something in the mail from Sallie saying that I had to start paying off my debt and that my interest had not been paid in over a year. (My father had originally agreed to pay for my interest but he fell into deep financial debt around that time and never paid it. It would have been nice if he told me.) I called them and agreed with the customer service rep that I could pay $209 a month. They originally wanted me to pay a little over $500 a month which I could not afford in any way, shape, or form. Even though $209 a month was still a little steep since I was only making $14 an hour for 30 hours a week at the time, I figured that was fair since my dad did not pay the interest. Well 4 years later, after paying between $209-$207 a month to Sallie Mae, I get a bill in the mail saying that they want $645 a month from me! I got this Thanksgiving weekend 2013, mind you. Those cowards...of course their customer service office is closed during the weekend, especially during Thanksgiving. I figured it had to be a mistake so I called them Monday and of course their lines were all busy. I put my name, account information, and phone number in so that a rep could call me back. Well, 4 hours later I finally get a phone call from a customer service rep at 8 P.M. telling him that this must be some mistake. He said it's not a mistake and that I owe $645 a month because their ""loan program"" is over and I was only paying $209 a month towards my interest. Seriously?? I was so mad. I tried to get the guy to lower my monthly payment but he wouldn't budge. I told them that I cannot pay that a month and I will try and pay as much as I can monthly. For December 2013, I paid about $215 in loans (federal and private). They had split up my loans into private and federal which they did before. I usually just paid towards both. Well after a couple of weeks, they kept calling me non-stop on my cell phone with an automated system telling me to check my account information. I was so sick and tired of hearing from them and getting emails sent to my phone that I called on December 23, 2013. I spoke with a woman this time and she told me the only options were to starting paying the $645 a month, or enroll in school. Seriously? I thought these companies were supposed to at least work with you. I only make $16/hour for 40 hours a week. I decided to go on forbearance and I agreed with the rep that I could still pay the federal loans monthly since it was only $75.00 a month. The private ones would cost me more than $500 a month. I agreed to the forbearance. Then beginning of January 2014 on the weekend I started getting phone calls from them again saying that my loans are past due even though my monthly payment is due on the 11th of each month and they called me on the 6th!!!!!! I was so irate. I called first Monday night and screamed at the girl on the phone that I am on forbearance. She tried to cut me off by saying ""but you have a private Stafford loan"" and I quickly cut her off by saying ""I am on forbearance since December 23, 2013 and have been paying off my federal loans. Please stop harassing me and calling me."" I have had it with this company. They finally stopped calling after that. It is now the end of February and my forbearance is over so I will now have to pay the $645 a month. I am getting so much anxiety over it because I cannot afford that a month. I wouldn't mind paying around $300 a month but I do not make that much money. I have been struggling to find another job for the past year so I cannot afford these payments but sadly I have not found a new one yet. This company is shameful and should not be allowed to demand money from people who can't afford it. At least work with people on how much they make so that they can make their payments without going bankrupt. Someone really needs to do something about Sallie Mae. They are ruining the lives of college graduates."

Their customer service provides no alternatives to help me (but my credit card company does? makes no sense). They hit you with late fees, fees, fees, fees when you're late. This is the equivalent of organized crime but with a nice website and backed by the federal government.Get this: I couldn't make payments after my grace period ($1,400 monthly) because 2009 was the worse year for finding jobs. They reported me to the credit bureau and destroyed my credit. I've been stuck with a 10% variable interest rate loan and they refuse to refinance because... get this: because of the late payments they flagged me for. They offer absolutely no way of flexibility and honestly, it was the worst decision I have made in my life to finance my education with Sallie Mae. My family and I live just to pay those loans... and the federal government offers no way to alleviate borrowers with Sallie Mae Private loans.My advice: go to a smaller name school which you can pay with a part-time/full time job, get the best GPA possible and go work for a company who is willing to pay for your masters.

AND if you don't, then expect your total loan amount to TRIPLE with collection fees, other fees, and interest. And then they garnish your wages and take your tax returns.

All day they called me. I threatened a cease and desist. Even though the letter was never sent they acted like it was and refused to speak to me. That's fine. I did not wish to speak to them.I complained to the consumer financial protection bureau. They called but never validated anything in writing or sent me proof of the loan. Now I find out it is considered an ""asset backed security"" and people were betting on me defaulting! Just like the mortgages! So without my knowledge or consent my loan was ""transferred"" from Sallie Mae to Sallie Mae! Wtf? My credit report from 2006 lists Sallie Mae, but there is no cosigner. Suddenly in 2012-14, my mother is a cosigner. Except she isn't! Every request for information or proof is ignored.

So I have been stuck at a 8% interest rate for 10 years only paying off 2000 of my principal balance at a payment of 225/mo.

It doesn't seem to matter I am still treated as if I am wrong. I have sent funds for my loans electronically through my bank with designations on which loan which payment is to apply, but it matters not. I have sent hard copy checks with designations for which loan the payment is to apply to, but still doesn't matter. I have sent hard copy checks in separate envelopes, same result. I have faxed proof but still being accused of nonpayment. What is worse is there is no offer to fix the damage Sallie Mae is doing to my credit score when they report me late. I have had it up to my eyebrows with this. My other lender, MOHELA, no problems whatsoever. I have recently applied to move my Sallie Mae loans.

However, I recently talked to my mom and she asked me about SM. I'm up to date on my payments, but she said they'd been receiving robocalls for me there--where I have never lived. She finally got tired of the calls so decided to take one and talk to a foreign chap, who wanted to know where I was and if she knew me? She said she knew me, but that was all, not who she was. She also said she caught the fool off guard when she told him she wasn't comfortable giving info over the phone and couldn't help him. On top of that, the idiot had the gall to ask for her social security number, which she told him she wasn't about to give him.I also found out they'd been harassing my dad, too, the same way, along with sending him junk mail. My dad doesn't answer numbers he doesn't know, or 800's so he won't talk to them. SM can virtually find anybody, but they're bugging my parents I'm sure about making payments?

I received numerous letters and I asked to be put into deferment. I haven't heard from these people in YEARS. Now all the sudden years later I'm married and my husband filed jointly, Saturday Feb 8 2014. We checked IRS site and they said his federal income taxes were applied to a financial obligation. We thought it was his child support. NOPE!!!!!! It was Sallie Mae. We have to now fight with IRS, filed a injured spouse form and have to wait 8 weeks for him to get his full return back because they were taking it. IRS and Sallie Mae are quick to take it. But are not quick to give it back. So basically if you know you have defaulted student loans, DO not file jointly. It SUCKS.

I've never had so much trouble paying loans in my life. My daughter has five loans with this 'organization.' Every single month I make a payment, which is more than what is due, in order to cut our ties with them as soon as we are able. I would send in one check with their invoice and the money I sent would be randomly applied to the five loans. Of course the amounts were nowhere near right and I ended up receiving late payment notices. After this happened for several months in a row, I decided that I would send five individual checks - one for each loan. I put both the account number and loan number on each check. This worked fine for all of 2013. Random amounts of money were applied to the five loans January 2014, none of which matched the amounts due in each account. After spending more than 30 minutes trying to get some woman in another country to understand my issue, I requested to speak with a supervisor and was told there were none in her location. I asked to speak with someone in the United States and was given some guy whom I am sure was another customer service (?) representative - probably a guy sitting right next to this woman. Needless to say, my entire lunch hour was used and I requested his telephone number in order that I could call him after work. He said he had no phone. Is this a joke????? I took three days to calm down and again called Sallie Mae and somehow I got everything straightened out. However, this representative told me to put only the 16 digit loan number on the check and to leave off the account number as it 'confuses the machine processing payments.  I did as she indicated and today looked at my account and loans. Once again, the loans are a complete mess. I sent in one check for $150 and only $131.14 was applied to the loan. My second check (each check now being sent in separate envelopes) was written for $32.25 and $18.55 was applied to the loan. The third check was for $22.16 and only $11.53 was applied to the loan. On loan #4, I sent a check for $57.97 and $27.89 was applied to the loan. Finally, I sent in a $100.00 check for loan #5 and $18.86 was applied to the loan. I can't even bring myself to call them today. My questions include where did these random amounts that were credited to the loans come from? How come the amounts of my checks credited to the loans as specified according to their directions? And, lastly, where is the $151.41 of my money that was never applied to my daughter's loans? I plan to go to the bank and take out a loan to pay that shoddy place off."

I also want the government to change the servicer of these loans to a different company. All of my private loans were charged off after incidents similar to everything posted thus far. All of my federal loans are now in SM's hands, which has the added bonus of giving them all the information they need to further mess things up.

I don't receive any kind of reliable notice about the issue and it's hard to know when you are actually past due because the payments take forever to process when they do actually go through. Then a payment was (allegedly) rejected by my bank when the funds were available and my banking info is unchanged after many many months of successful payments. I have an intense disdain for the poor business practices and customer service at Sallie Mae. Many of the people who have these loans are already under financial stress and it is a crime to make people who are actually trying to pay back their loans undergo the additional stress of dealing with this company."
2014-02-05 22:57:59,"Dallas, TX",val,1.0,"Well let me begin by saying that I have never seen an agency so rude and uncaring as Sallie Mae. It's strange how they are suppose to be an institution that is suppose to assist their fellowmen in achieving higher education. When in actuality they are loan sharks and very judgmental. It started when I went through TurboTax, filing for the 2013 tax season. I had a refund anticipation date of February 6, 2014. Keep in mind that I owed a student loan for the previous year that went into default due to a divorce and several other mishaps. Needless to say my taxes were offset last year. I owed the money, so after mourning the loss of my $4,000 tax refund I pulled myself up by my boot straps. There was no way that I would let this happen again so I made arrangements with a second party contracted to collect debts on Sallie Mae's behalf. The terms of my agreement consisted of me making nine on time payments and I would then be taken out of default and my file would be transferred to another collection agency. As of December 21, 2013 I was out of default, all information was reported to the Department of Education. I was so proud of myself, I made a mistake and took responsibility for my actions. I just knew that I would have a refund this year. So let's move forward to the present shall we? As I said I filed with Turbo Tax and on the 23rd of January I was accepted and in the next few days approved to receive my refund by the 6th of February. On February 3rd I received a notice that said I may have an offset of my refund. I was thinking, not me, I did everything that they told me to do. I concluded that they probably sent this message to everyone but I called the offset department just to be safe. Guess what? My refund is due to be offset again this year. How and why? So I contacted the Department of Education and told them what happened. They informed me that someone (who knows who) was suppose to contact them and let them know to take me off of the offset list. Keep in mind that I asked the collection agency if there was anything that I needed to do and they said that THEY report to the Department of Education. Who dropped the ball here? It was then stated that MY taxes would be sent to them and they'll mail me a check 30 to 60 days. I told them that it was their fault so they needed to fix it. To make a very long story short, I was on the telephone for about four hours speaking to every federal agency that I could think of. Everyone redirected me back to the Dept. of Education. So in a last ditch effort to get my taxes I called back. The person (and I use that term loosely) that I spoke to was arrogant and constantly stated that I will eventually get my money. She even asked me if it was their fault that I was in default. After I read her the riot act I found this website to release my frustrations. I feel better now and thank you for listening."

They are trying to contact someone else with my phone. I called today, and told them to take my number out of their records, and was met with rudeness. Oh, and let's talk about the persistence of trying to get my social security number. Was asked three times for it, on the third time I told them, ""Hell no, you're not getting my social number."" They hung up on me. I guess time will tell if they actually took my number off their list. I really feel for anyone who has gotten a loan with this business."

Just recently (today included), relatives and acquaintances who were never listed on any loan documents were contacted by phone by Sallie Mae. My wife receive a call today. In every case, the caller used nicknames of the recipient of the call. None were the legal names that these individuals use to sign documents. I paid off the loans myself to stop these calls from Sallie Mae. 8 years later and they want to update their files? Contact my son in whose name the loans are. Avoid all contact with these people... and I doubt you'll find an address or e-mail account to contact them at."
2014-02-03 23:57:37,"Ridgefield, WA",Cheryl,1.0,"I would love to work for Sallie Mae to see how they train their employees and how they use their computer system because every time I call it seems the employees I talk to can NEVER agree and I ALWAYS get a different answer. I have both federal and private loans with Sallie Mae that I pay online. I have not missed a payment and have even made double payments. My $600 a month goes to my interest only, anything after that goes towards the balance because I selected to have a lower payment for 2 years versus a $1100 payment that went towards principal and balance. I took out $60000 in school loans and already have $40,000 in interest and will have paid a total of $120,000 in interest by the time I am finish with Sallie Mae in 20 years. (The interest has collected over 10 years but still, that is a lot!). I am trying to do the best I can by making my payments on time, I even live with my parents because with a baby, daycare, and my school loan I can't afford to live elsewhere. I filed bankruptcy in October because I hard a large medical bill from when I didn't have insurance and had to take unpaid maternity leave. My cosigner has received letters from Sallie Mae since October saying my account is past due. I called and when they found out I wasn't the cosigner but the borrower they said not to worry about it, that it was an automatic mailing and they couldn't collect money from me until my bankruptcy was discharged. So I put it in my file and ignored it. November same thing, December same thing, January same thing. I called each time and even called the day my bankruptcy was discharged to see how much my payment would be and what day it would be due. They said they could not tell me how much but that it would be due March 22 and the other March 28. Well today I got a call saying my account was 4m past due and I owed over $1000 to bring my account current. I asked them how that was even possible and got the runaround. Even after talking to a supervisor they couldn't tell me how things didn't add up. I paid $600 in October when I wasn't obligated to under bankruptcy law and yet my account was past due? They said I only paid $395 when my bank statement says otherwise. So shady, wish they would get on the same page, put better notes in their system, and just stick with simple math. You borrowed this much, your interest will be this much, and you will pay this much. There is no reason to change the interest, account numbers, and site every year, makes it way more confusing for them apparently. Sallie Mae is such a waste, they just care about getting money, not about improving society by allowing individuals to get an education."
2014-02-02 17:40:37,"Aberdeen, MD",lavette,1.0,My daughter has a loan thru Sallie Mae in which we have been making payments on when she was still in school. It been 3 yrs and we've paid 80 per month on an $8000 loan. As of today her balance is $8500 and the loan rate is 12.99%. How is this possible? We have tried on numerous occasion to get someone to explain to us how this is possible. There are moments that some money is applied to the interest and other months nothing for 5-6 months then conveniently $11 appears on the principal. This doesn't make any sense on any level. I have expressed this to them on several occasions and requested they send me the statements with payments and interest since the beginning of the payment process which has yet to happen. Now the payments will double and I feel that we are paying and getting nowhere with the balance it keeps increasing. This is unjust. How could the government allow this company to remain in business. I live in MD and requested to go to the office in DE and was told I wasn't allowed to do that. I'm at the end of my rope and I will be filing a complaint with the attorney general's office and seeking an attorney.
2014-02-01 05:55:51,"Cuyahoga Falls, OH",John,1.0,"Sallie Mae allowed my wife to acquire $40,000 in student loans in a single year by listing my name as a cosigner on a web page using e-commerce without my knowledge. There is no signature on these loans (all Internet). The E-commerce Act does not contain the word cosigner. Sallie Mae is reading into the law for their greed at the cost of my credit. I reported the loans as fraud, but Sallie Mae told me that they would do nothing until the police were involved. The police hung up on me twice after muttering ""domestic"". The city prosecutor wrote a report stating that there was not enough evidence. This ruined my marriage and my credit forever. Sallie Mae continues to use different collection agencies which resets the credit clock on this debt. The value is beyond a small claim, and there is no established industry for lawyers to get involved. I paid several attorneys to get involved, one said ""divorce her"", another said she would have no idea how to sue a bank, and the latest included the Fair Credit Act in the suit which got it thrown out for untimely (1 year statute). I involved every office possible, from the FTC to the Student Loan Ombudsman. NO HELP!This must to be a rampant problem that stays quiet when a desperate student lists family as a cosigner for student loans. Sallie Mae secures more student loans, because family will not report family for fraud. They will honor the loan rather than send family to jail. This needs to be a class action against Sallie Mae. The same greed that brought them to the top should bring them down. I am reaching my sanity limit.My credit would be perfect, and Sallie Mae is content with ruining me until I pay them $60,000 for the principal and interest on Internet acquired loans. Even if I sued my wife to get out of this, my life is still turned inside out between how to manage my kids and my job. Sallie Mae put $40,000 in a candy dish, and they act like it's my problem to deal with."

They've called me and said they were saying she defaulted. I told them I am making payments. I've made several call. Some calls I was told they had it straightened out as they see payments. One man told me to prove it. I did by sending a jpeg showing payment. Everyday I get a recording from Sallie Mae between 6:30 - 7PM telling me to call to set up payment.

My credit is ruined, and I can't get these bloodthirsty leeches off of me. I owe over $147,000 according to them. They have called my house during holidays, weekends, family members' houses, and just about all times of the day. I have had them remind me that they keep my tax return.My husband is a post 911 disabled veteran, and we have struggled financially and these bloodthirsty leeches, have wanted nothing but money during our most difficult times of our lives. In 2012, they kept our tax return and we had just been told by our landlord that we needed to vacate the home, because they were selling, and we had been expecting the tax return to rent a home. Unfortunately, we ended up selling all our furniture and moving to Puerto Rico, because we couldn't rent, because our credit was affected by the Student Loans, but the worst part was that we needed that money to survive and they kept every penny of it. We were forced to live in a very rundown home with no water or electricity because we couldn't stay long with family in Puerto Rico.We have to settle for close to nothing, because no one would rent to us due to these Student Loans. When I tried calling to settle they tell me they are charged off and sent to USA Funds, a debt collector for Sallie Mae. So, we are screwed, we can't afford to live a decent life, all because I decided to finish my last two years of college. I wish I could turn back the clock, because I owe more in Student Loans than a doctor or lawyer and all I have is a Bachelor's degree that is not even worth having, because since 2007 I have not been able to find a decent job to help pay bills. Congress needs to bail out families just like they bailed out all these banks and companies.

I have complained to the Ombudsman group that is suppose to help you with problems such as this, as well as the Department of Education. They need to be reported immediately and investigated, I think its unfair how they are treating people who are trying to do the best that they can. The payment they have listed for me is well above the monthly pay I get monthly, how am I suppose to pay for that. Please, who ever reads this don't ever get a loan of any kind with Sallie Mae.

Most recently I have spent an hour and 14 minutes on hold while waiting to speak with someone about lowering my payments. Each operator was hard to understand and immediately transferred me to another department, where I would automatically get kicked back to their main menu. I am a customer in good standing; I have never missed a payment on my outrageously high interest rate student loans, and now at 28 years old, I am needing to postpone payments while I am on unpaid leave from work due to a major injury. No one I spoke with was able to help me, saying I had previously used the 12-month forbearance period several years back. Unbelievable that they are unwilling to work with someone in my situation. I NEVER recommend Sallie Mae to anyone, and if I could do it over, I would have never gone through Sallie Mae for my student loans."

I have now spoken to their India customer service for 7 consecutive months (probably 14 hours of wasted time). Each person assures me that just one of my 8 different loans is not enrolled in auto debit but that it is no problem to add that loan to auto-debit. So I say yes please that is why I am calling and ask them for confirmation that the loan has been added, which they cannot give since it is another department that actually processes the request.SURE ENOUGH EVERY SINGLE MONTH, THE AUTO DEBIT DOES NOT WORK AND I RECEIVE A NOTICE THAT MY LOANS ARE DELINQUENT. I then log on to their confusing website to pay one loan manually and call customer service again to be assured that NEXT TIME IT WILL WORK FOR SURE. I think I finally figured out the problem (on my own). It takes this horrible excuse for a company longer than one month to process my auto debit request. If your loans are ""delinquent"" then your auto debit request is rejected. So it is impossible to sign up for auto debit without logging on and manually paying this specific loan for 2 straight months BEFORE it is due but AFTER my auto debit request. THANKS SALLIE MAE!

I have had temp jobs, been laid off due to the economy and had multiple medical procedures. Sallie Mae at one point was charging me $897 a month, which I paid. I lost my job about a year or so later and had to lower it to $300-$400 a month. Then all of a sudden I went delinquent because they changed my dates without my knowledge, then they changed my minimum payment, without my knowledge. I originally got the automatic payment but then when I all of a sudden was $500 overdrawn I lost it! They don't get back to you when you try to get a hold of them, you can't get a human on the phone, they're rude and super shady. The government needs to step up and do something, they want us ""young people"" to do well and bring back the economy? Well take the chains off us first.

2014-01-21 01:58:04,"Valencia, CA",C.,1.0,"I am having the same problem as many of the other people. I make my payments through my bank online and have received numerous letters saying I have not paid. It shows that the money was withdrawn from my account though and paid to Sallie Mae. I too have spent hours on the phone with their customer service representatives telling me it is my problem or my banks problem. In September 2012, I called and was told they had changed my account number. I changed it to what they told me, along with the address and verified twice that I had it right. All is good. Then I get a letter in October and same thing. Delinquent payment. I called the number again (I used the website number because I wanted to be sure it was not a 'fake' letter to get my information). Again, it was at least an hour. This time, when I asked why it didn't go through after I had changed my account number they said they never changed my account number or address. I was furious because when I told them they had told me to do so. They said there was no record. However, my money from the previous month was showing as paid now. I changed the information yet again and when I demanded to speak to a supervisor to explain this to me, I was laughed at by the representative. I hung up. I have since received 2 more letters with the same issue. The latest payment was made January 2nd and I received a letter on January 18, 2014 saying I had not made a payment. I don't even want to call them at this point or make any more payments and just suffer the consequences. They are corrupt and charging people fees and interest on things that were paid. I am at the point I don't care. It is too stressful. I have not worked in 8 years due to health problems, but am not ""permanently"" disabled. I have $214,000 in student loan debt and have made every payment on time. We have our 3 kids sharing a room in a tiny condo we rent so we can pay my student loans. It is very stressful and we see no way out. If this harassment by Sallie Mae continues, I may just stop payments. If they don't want my money I am paying them, they don't have to have it. My time is more valuable than spending hours trying to fix problems that are their problems. I should start billing them for my time."
2014-01-17 22:21:09,"Menifee, CA",Heather,1.0,Several years ago shortly after I graduated college I started making my student loan payments directly to the Department of Education. I didn't think anything was wrong until about a year later when I receive a letter in the mail from Sallie Mae telling me that my loans were 12 months in default. I was very confused by this because I was making my payments to the Department of Education. Come it find out Sallie Mae owned a couple of my loans and I was completely unaware of this. I never received a payment. According to Sallie Mae they were emailing me payment notices but I never received those either. Sallie Mae did bring my account current by placing a deferment on the account but there were 12 missed payments on my credit and Sallie Mae refused to correct that. I consolidated my loans into one loan with Direct Loans to get them away from Sallie Mae. Due to life circumstances I was unable to make the $300 payment and placed the loan in forbearance. I do not receive statements while the loan is in forbearance and won't receive one until the forbearance is over. I received one a while back and placed the loan back into forbearance. I just found out through a third party that Sallie Mae has purchased my loan and once again owns it. Sallie Mae took my loan out of forbearance and placed it in repayment. I was not notified of this and have not received a statement from them. Once again I have late payments by no fault of my own. My credit is very poor because of this and made buying a car difficult and a house impossible. It doesn't matter what I do I can't win and my loans keep ending up back at Sallie Mae who is continually damaging my credit.
2014-01-16 04:08:13,"Seattle, WA",jenn,1.0,"I pay my bill on time every month. It is automatically deducted from my bank account and I have both private and federal loans. I have had near a dozen instances where they have emailed me to let me know one of my accounts is delinquent, which is impossible because I PAY ON TIME EVERY MONTH WITH AUTOMATIC DEDUCTIONS FROM MY BANK ACCOUNT. Every time this happens, it results in a three hour phone call for me, and I am not exaggerating this. No one knows what happened. No one seems to believe my payments are auto deducted. They need to transfer me. The call then gets dropped. I call back. Again, I start from scratch. I have had people tell me it was my fault, I should be paying on time. They don't know what to do. I didn't set things up properly, etc. After an obscene amount of time and energy on my part, the problem seems to be resolved, and I am assured that they have ""corrected the matter and I should not have to deal with this issue again."" But, guess what? Two months later, without fail, I am getting emails again with delinquency notices, and so the cycle of insanity begins again. Now I try very hard to be a generally calm person, but this just makes my blood boil every time. I am at a complete loss of what to do. I fulfill my end of the bargain, I PAY MY BILL!!!! What else should I do??? The incompetence of the people who run this company is astonishing. I have had negative reports on my credit because of this issue, countless lost hours, and incredible amount of necessary stress. The thing is, I feel like there is nothing I can do.

2014-01-14 22:17:52,"Prattsburgh, NY",joseph,1.0,"Being the co-signer of my son's student loans, I thought I could help him out. After he graduated I tried to consolidate and refinance all of his student loans to get a lower interest rate. Sallie Mae loans averaged around 8 percent. I was able to get a home equity loan with my house as collateral at around 3 percent. My Bank paid off Sallie Mae in full in October 2013. In November I still received statements from Sallie Mae saying a payment was due January 3. I called Sallie Mae and and was put on hold for twenty minutes before I could speak to a representative. But then after discussion I was informed there would be a loan investigation team put on it and when they figured it out they would contact me. So periodically I would check the website and our balance still should up as not being paid off. Then I got a statement in the mail still showing the balance not being paid off. I called again and again and was told that the investigation team would call me when they figured out what went wrong and I would not be charged interest or penalties after the date my bank had paid them off, numerous times I was told this. One person named Lisa told me she would get to the bottom of this and get it straightened out, but to give her time and call her back in mid January. Then I would receive and emails telling me to check the website for information on the loan, which I did and it still should a balance and payment was due on January 3, 2014. I called Sallie Mae again and a representative told me not to worry this is happening a lot and they would not charge me any fees or interest after my banks closing date. Then I received a message on my phone from my bank and she said to call her or stop down. I am not going to believe this one. I stopped in the next day and my bank received a check back from Sallie Mae for 37 thousand and something for a refund of overpayment. Who in their right mind would overpay a loan by 37 thousand? We were not sure where to go from there, she said she wouldn't cash it and just leave it in my file. I called every week to try to get this figured out, being put on hold for 20 min to 45 min and sometimes getting cut off, but no one I talked to knew what was going on but assured me I would not be charged ant penalties or interest after my banks closing date in October. Then after January 3rd went by and I was getting phone calls and notices that payment was overdue I suggested to a Sallie Mae Representative that I needed to get a three way conversation going with my bank and straighten this out. We did this Last Thursday and talked with a person name Trisha and her supervisor named Hunter. We figured out that the delinquent loans were with Sallie Mae Inc. and the other seven loans with Sallie Mae Department of Education. And my Bank had sent the pay off amounts to the Sallie Mae Department of Education. So they cashed them all, computed interest from when my son had took the loans out, added that to the principle amounts and took out their share and sent the remaining balance back to my bank with very little explanation. So once we figured this out we sent the refund check amount in a cashiers check from my bank and I paid the 2300 dollars worth of interest that had accumulated in another check to Sallie Mae Inc. and explained to Trisha and Hunter that it would be there Monday, 1/13/14. Trisha and Hunter both informed my bank and I that I would not be charged interest or penalties after the closing date, for this mishap. Friday I called again to check to make sure we did everything correctly and I first spoke to and oriental lady that I could understand very well and I tried to explain things to her. I gave up and asked if I could speak to her supervisor and she connected me with a guy named Keith. I discussed things with him and he asked If I was the one that called previously and I said yes. He then went on to inform me about the loans that they said we were delinquent on which were the ones thru Sallie Mae Inc. and I had called a number for Sallie Mae Department of Education. A little confused, but I was talking to a manager that I could understand so I continued. He explained to me that he thought that they could not waive the interest from October to January and it amounted to $840.43. When I told him I had been told I would not be charged interest by several people along the way, he said that Hunter was a new person to the company and that he and all the rest of the Sallie Mae Representatives had been misinformed and that I would have to pay this interest within 10 days. Today I took another day off from work and sat down with my bank and called Sallie Mae, again to try to straighten things out. Trisha and Hunter were unavailable so we ended up talking with Kieth again. He said Upper management made a decision not to wave the interest charge from October to January and that we could not speak with them but he could give them my number and they would call me if they felt they had to. I then paid Sallie Mae Inc. the $840.43 over the phone to put and end to this madness. Angry doesn't describe what you feel like when you have been scammed. My bank has paid off Sallie Mae Loans before and this has never been an issue. Apparently Sallie Mae Department of Education used to communicate with Sallie Mae Inc.until some manager from Sallie Mae Department of Education decided to send refund checks back to the source and collect interest for as long as it took for the client to straighten things out. Unfortunately I am a single parent/recent widower just trying to put my two sons thru engineering colleges so they can support themselves in the future and it has been one nightmare after another. I will never do business with Sallie Mae Again!!! !"

It is not a luxury but a necessity), utility bills and food. Each month the bill keeps going up in the monthly fee.

But the lack of sleep for working so much is slowly affecting my health, and in return I will have another expense in taking care of my self.

2014-01-11 01:56:40,"Metairie, LA",Mary,1.0,"I requested a forbearance from SM in early Jan 2014. SM denied my forbearance because they said I exhausted my all my chances. I used last year to stabilize my finances and things were going terrific until my son tried to commit suicide. Needless to say, that threw me into more than just a financial whirlwind. I am paying off hospital bills now as well as a prior student loan.When I called SM, I asked them to please reconsider and to let me apply for economic hardship. I would find a way to pay something. The rep on the other end of the phone kept putting me on hold. He said that I would be granted another forbearance for another year, but that this would be the absolute last time. I asked him about deferment. He said, because my loans were consolidated, I relinquished the right to deferment for economic hardship. That sounds a little sketchy to me, but okay - a forbearance would be better than nothing. When I told him about the medical condition of my son and that I would send whatever documentation was needed to prove it, he said, ""That will not be necessary. I am pre approving your forbearance now. It will not go into effect until your current forbearance is exhausted and you are within 30 days of your payment date."" That sounded sketchy also, but the rep seemed so nice, helpful, and knowledgeable! After I was approved, I asked the rep about the Teacher Loan Forgiveness Program. We spoke about amounts that could be forgiven. He said he would send me an application, which I received on Jan. 8th. When I received the application, it was titled Information about your requested forbearance. When I opened the letter, I saw only the teacher loan forgiveness application. Another sketchy feeling came over me. I took the survey at the end of my conversation with this rep because I was so overjoyed to get this forbearance. I had another year to straighten out the hospital bills that I had not counted on. It seemed too good to be true.This afternoon I called SM just as the rep instructed. Today is the day after my last forbearance. I spoke to another rep. I told her I had been pre approved for another and last forbearance just a few days ago - I just had to call to activate it. This rep informed me that no such forbearance was approved by anyone. She said that the only note she saw read, Once the Teacher Loan Forgiveness Application is filled out and approved, the forbearance will be approved. This was NEVER even mentioned by the prior rep. Teacher Loan forgiveness was brought up by me after the prior rep approved my forbearance. The rep told me tonight that I had other payment options. I can pay no more than $100 a month - and that is stretching it. I was so outraged that I had been lied to by the prior rep. that when the current rep told me about another repayment option, and that she was sorry I was misinformed I broke down over the phone. The prior SM rep did not misinform me: He LIED to me. He misrepresented himself. He even tried to talk me into a SM credit card! Luckily, I knew better.I do not want to default on this loan. I want to pay it back. I will pay what I can over the year, but I was counting on this forbearance (actually hoping for a deferment). I was already mapping out payments for the medical bills and SM after that first rep told me I was approved. I will be applying for the Teacher Loan Forgiveness program, which I hope will be approved, but I must put my son's mental, emotional, and physical health first. I am a single parent and it has been difficult - in other words, there is no other income. Why would this rep falsify promise of forbearance??? To get a good grade on the survey I took at the end of the conversation? Isn't what he did against the law? Aren't the conversations recorded? He told me I was pre-approved - that I needed to call back to activate the forbearance. He told me I did not qualify for economic hardship and I could not receive deferment. I would have to pay the interest on the forbearance. What did this rep gain by falsifying a pre-approved forbearance??? Just for the record, I did not give my real name for this online post. I want to keep my name private because my child is mentioned here. But everything else here is true, as God as my witness. If I can sue SM the cost of my student loan debt for what this rep did, then please put me on that train. I did send this exact letter to a Sallie Me advocate to see what they can do, but if they work for SM, it seems like I would be making a pact with the devil himself: Sallie Mae advocating for me after their rep falsified a forbearance request (????) Yeah- okay. I am required to give at least one star to SM, but if I had my choice here on this website, I would put NO STAR."
2014-01-10 16:24:16,"Lake Ronkonkoma, NY",Jeffrey,1.0,"Last year, I was never notified I had to renew my IBR plan and suddenly my auto debit bank account was emptied. Sallie Mae debited 15x the amount they normally do from my bank account. I called back asked why and they said it was because I did not renew my IBR payment - fine - half their fault for not notifying me, half my fault for not remembering from a year earlier. I asked them what to do, they told me to send in 2 of my recent pay stubs or my latest tax return and the process would be done in 5-7 days, but I would not get a refund on the amount they debited; however, they could cancel the payment. They failed to inform me canceling the payment would be a deferment and I'd have to go through all sorts of b.s. I had to bite the bullet on this one.I sent in 2 pay stubs and CLEARLY noted on the cover page that I am paid 9 months out of the year, not 12 (teacher). 8 days later, I had not received approval. I e-mailed customer service and got a notification that I would receive approval within 7-14 more days. I waited, still no approval. I emailed again, they said 24-48 hours. Guess what? NO APPROVAL. This is over the course of the next 2 months. I called - first time, they apologized and said they'd do it in 24 hours. Not done. I called again, they apologized, they said they would call me back after they spoke to the processing dept. They never called back. 3rd call was to a supervisor who said he'd call me back by the end of the week. NO CALL.My next payment was due - they debited roughly 7x my normal payment. I called to find out why, they said my application was approved. They calculated my income as what I made in those 2 pay stubs over the course of 12 months, not 9 months. Here we go again... I had to reapply for IBR and the same b.s. process happened. This time, I immediately asked for a manager, and in a frustrated tone (choice words) explained what was going on, didn't take no for an answer, demanded to constantly speak to someone higher than whoever got on the phone. I finally got someone who sounded legitimate, they gave me the phone number and e-mail contact of a woman named Charolotte and told me to call her extension directly. I did so. Charolette called me back immediately, explained the processing dept. had overlooked my pay stubs notation that I get paid over 9 months, not 12 months. I told her that I explained that to everyone but nobody understood. She told me to upload my recent tax return. She got it done ON THE SPOT with me on the phone. The only bright side of this post. Here I am a year later... This year, I put my tax return in. I got the same b.s. delayed responses from Sallie Mae stating 2 weeks, 24 hours, 24 hours blah blah blah. I am literally on hold right now with a 'managing supervisor' who claims to be on the phone with the processing department to get this done again... If she doesn't come through I'll be asking for her supervisors direct number. To be continued.... P.S. this year's IBR renewal has taken over a month at this point. Don't let them give you excuses. Tell them you want your written approval prior to the next payment cycle."
2014-01-10 03:06:54,"Towson, MD",Renee,1.0,My daughter recently graduated from college. We paid a minimum payment until about 1 month ago....As a previous complainant stated phone calls started...to her phone and mine. I contacted Sallie Mae to get the payment decreased....I was advised that I pay way to much in gas and definitely have money left over to pay the $600.00 a month payment. Jinao is a crazy person! I am sure she is going off a script....Wish I would have done research before getting this loan!!
2014-01-03 18:16:06,"Boothwyn, PA",Carol,1.0,"My son borrowed money from Sallie Mae for college tuition in 2001-2005. As a parent I was told he could not get the money unless I co-signed. We paid monthly but when he lost his job in 2008, I asked to pay less. My son was unemployed for two years and then underemployed for two years. He lost all his insurance and did not go to the dentist for 5 years and now had $5,000 of dental work. We pay Sallie Mae what we can but they threaten us with bad credit and everything else. Last month they called my cell phone, house phone and my son's phone 560 times. Calls start @ 830 a and stop 830 p. Someone last month told me I have $195.00 left at the end of the month so I should give it to them. Who knew the economy would be so bad for so many years. I am about to hit financial ruin because of their predatory lending."
2014-01-01 04:56:27,"Grovetown, GA",selwyn,1.0,"Sallie Mae gives your loan to a debit collector. The collector calls your phone, tells you the name of the agency which sounds like a regular company like a telemarketer trying to sell you something. They verify who you are then they tell you that they are a debit collecting agency. They argue with you about you paying money if you don't give that agency any money then telling me will retract the account and give it to another debit collecting agency. The previous data collecting agency goes on your credit report as a bad thing, lowering your credit score.This vicious cycle continues until your credit score is low. My first signs of issues with Sallie Mae was when they sent me a letter in the mail telling me they took me to court without me knowing and winning. Let's talk about the credit agency names the first one is NCO financial if your military at first you think it's the military helping nope just a trick to get you to pay, they don't tell you what the APR is which can possible be sky rocket high loan shark tactics."
2013-12-26 15:36:43,"Hereford, AZ",Scott,1.0,"Here's what's happening with me and the dear Sallie Mae. I returned to college at the age of 36. Two years at a Junior College that only cost $11.00 a credit. Obviously, I was able to pay that out of pocket, even though I had to switch from full-time to part-time at my job. Then I went to university for the last two years. After graduation I lost my former job and found another at a lower pay rate. Anyway, as with many of you, when I tried to start paying back the loans, trouble began almost immediately. I had four loans; two subsidized and two not. I would pay the loans online, but in less than a month, Sallie Mae would send an email stating that I hadn't made a payment. Eventually, I moved to another state to work on my teaching degree. Since then, SM has been nothing but trouble. After graduating I found a job teaching, as according to plan. However, the amount I made was not enough to pay the full amount each month and allow for my other expenses. I called SM, whose call center appears to be in the Philippines, and asked for a lower payment. The amount was still too high and I suggested an amount that I could afford until such a time as I was in a better financial position. The person at the call center said they could not accept anything but the full payment and suggested I get a deferment. Things still have not improved concerning my financial situation and I have left the teaching field after five years.The other day, I received two statements saying that my new payments would be 73.49 a month per loan. However, this morning in my email I received a statement saying that my payment due was over $600.00. After a ""wonderful"" conversation, with a person who had a tenuous grasp of the English language, I was informed that the statements only pertained to two of my loans and that the total of all four of my loans was the $600.00 figure. Again, I told her that I would be willing to pay the 73.00 for each loan, totaling $292.00 per month. I also told her she better not suggest that I get, yet another, deferment or I would chew her head off (said in the nicest way possible). She was adamant that I pay the entire amount. What kind of business would turn down a person that was sincerely trying to pay them back? Sure, it's not the full amount, but it's something! I'm about to tell them to take a flying leap (sure, that's what I want to say..) and default entirely on the loan. I know this is not the right thing to do and I don't feel good about doing it, but they're leaving me no choice. STAY AWAY FROM SALLIE MAE!!!"
2013-12-21 00:09:29,"Columbus, OH",saundra,1.0,"They are saying payments are late. Trying to charge late fees. This is very familiar, sounds like predatory lending. Why are they now offering scholarships? My daughter cannot find a job in her field. I believe her youth and inexperience was taken advantage of. Why aren't they helping her find a job in her field? They state this in their advertising. They need to be investigated. What a shame welfare recipients get free educations and blue collar parents can't help their kids as much."
2013-12-09 15:15:43,"New York, NY",D. M.,1.0,"I discovered recently in dealing with a seemingly separate issue that Sallie Mae has been altering the dates of my payment recalculations under IBR. Under this plan my monthly payment amount for the year is recalculated annually based on my income. This is supposed to occur every 12 months. According to documentation received last year confirming my re-approval for IBR, my then-new payment amount was to start on 1/18/13 and end on 12/18/13. This year I was prompted to reapply in September - when I received this year's confirmation of re-approval, it stated that my new amount would go into effect 11/18/13 and end 9/18/14. This is wrong on several levels: 1) I am supposed to pay 12 months at each given payment amount. This year's new amount should have started on 1/18, as it did last year, not two months earlier in November. 2) Even if November were the correct start date, they have the end date listed as 9/18. But each IBR re-application is supposed to go for 12 months, not 11. 3) To further complicate matters, Sallie Mae did not even adhere to the documentation stating 11/18 as this year's start date - instead they debited the new amount from my account on 10/18, thus making my payments at the new higher amount start a full 3 months earlier than they were supposed to, and unfairly taking money that I am not supposed to be paying yet. I have contacted Sallie Mae 5 times and not gotten anywhere with them. I have also contacted the Federal Ombudsman's office and asked for intervention."
2013-12-07 18:46:06,"West Orange, NJ",Linda,1.0,"I went to a school, applied for a loan. The school was a fraud. They had a story about them on 20/20. I have had this loan for more than 20 years. I even paid half of it off. I have not worked for a while and I am receiving food stamps. I have gotten a call every week for the past few months asking me for 1591 to get my account in order. Really! Why is Sallie Mae traded on the stock exchange? I looked it up what percentage of people actually pay back their loans is less than one percent."
2013-12-07 02:00:14,"Brooklyn, NY",ct,1.0,"On Nov 18, 2013, spoke to Sallie Mae rep who gave me an option to accept forbearance over phone. She read me the disclosure and then asked me to accept terms, I did so and was confirmed for forbearance. Some weeks later, I contacted Sallie Mae on a separate subject. After speaking to rep obviously in a call center offshore (who was reluctant to identify her call center), I was informed that I was in repayment. I replied that is incorrect, I was approved for forbearance on Nov 18. She replied, ""We have no record of that,"" and after much back and forth she transferred me to a supervisor. The supervisor finally acknowledged that I did apply for forbearance on that date but it was subsequently denied when I did accept terms at the end of call.  I replied, ""That's outrageous, why would I decline the forbearance after requesting so and accepting the terms."" Furthermore, if I did not accept terms then why did the rep fail to inform me that the request for forbearance was not complete and I did not accept. I clearly accepted terms and was told so and was approved by rep. It's clear that the rep after the call did not process the request properly and thus I'm back to square one with possibility of default. Of course the supervisor replied, ""Oh no problem, we'll just process another phone forbearance request."" At this point, I'm irate and request that nothing should move forward until you acknowledge the mistake and rectify it immediately so that I am not penalized once more. She refused and that got nasty and told me that somebody else (i.e., previous rep) erred in processing the claim and that I should accept that and move forward with her (supervisor) offer or I will be processed for default. I declined her offer and am documenting this now on this forum to see if anybody else has experienced such ineptness from this organization and have suggestion what to do next. I am not that naive to Sallie Mae's business practices but this mishandling tops a new level of ineptness till the point where I actually believe they do this intentionally..."
2013-12-03 00:50:07,"Lombard, IL",R. C.,1.0,"You would think they would work with me to lower my payments so I could have some leftover money to live on while paying off my student loans. I somehow come up with $150 for my 3 loans every three months to put my loans on forbearance until I can find a full time job to make my $1600 monthly payment, but Sallie Mae CANNOT post my payment on my account correctly!!! I have to call them 3-4 times every time they make these errors and until they make their adjustments, my account gets classified delinquent!!! Sallie Mae knows how to process these payments through my bank account but can't post it on my account correctly! I am trying to keep what's left of my credit score but Sallie Mae is so incompetent to at least do their job! I work to try to come up with the money and then I have to call them to help them correct their errors. The last time I spoke with them, I was on the phone for an hour and 11 minutes. If you are reading this and considering to do business with Sallie Mae, please do yourself a favor and save your money, time, and energy from dealing with this company!!!"
2013-11-29 06:00:01,"Rushville, NY",Jacob,1.0,"Beware of using Sallie Mae private loans. The interest is not the only extra charge that they will apply. There are hidden insurance fees that keeps the payments minimal and the principal high. I had a loan for $10,000 but only used $7,800 of it. I immediately paid the $2,200 back to Sallie Mae. By the end of one year the balance owed was over $10,000. In one year the interest and fees that were charged on the loan increased the balance by approximately 30 percent. That seems like it's an extraordinary amount to me. I didn't want to take this loan out to begin with but wanted to finish my final year of college without working too much. So, my goal was to pay this debt off as soon as possible. My first bill arrived and was approximately $70. I paid $1,000 and waited for the next bill. After a few months without receiving a bill I called and worked my way through the automated service. Inconveniently, I was disconnected on quite a few occasions. I did finally get my next bill about a year later. I called Sallie Mae to ask for a monthly bill. However, I was informed that it is against Sallie Mae's policy to send a bill if you are ahead of payment schedule. Even if you request one. I have not dealt with any other loan company that has this policy. It is very inconvenient for someone like me who wants to pay the loans off early. And in my opinion should not be legal. Especially, when you consider all the extra fees this company will charge you. In fact over the period of one year between the time I paid the first $1,000 and got the next bill my principal balance had only decreased about $120. Approximately $10 a month for a principal that was over $10,000. At that rate, how is that bill ever going to get paid off? Over the year that I waited for the next bill I saved enough to pay off the entire loan. However, to borrow $7,800 for two years it cost me over $3,000.My wife has had a similar situation on private loans from Sallie Mae for approximately $13,000. I have not calculated the exact numbers. Partially, because is extremely aggravating to know that a company is getting away with this type of robbery. I started making her payments over 2 years ago. And again, following the principal found out that it was only decreasing by approximately $12 a month after all the fees and interest were paid. For this loan I did the same thing and saved the balance to pay it off. Only this time I made minimum monthly payments until I had saved enough to cover the entire balance. This way I could watch the monthly changes until I was ready to pay in full. Upon calling Sallie Mae and working through the automation service I finally reached a representative. Typical these days, but still inconvenient. The balance on the loan was still over $12,500 after paying $155 a month for about 3 years. I asked the representative for an exact balance so that I could make a payment by phone to pay the entire balance. She told me that I had to guess the exact amount since I was not the recipient of the loan. She told me this even though I was on the account and I had made all the payments for 2+ years. I also got the run around with her telling me that it would be $14 cheaper to pay online. I had just read to her that the last bill stated that the balance on the account was $12,488.49. She knew my intention was to pay the balance off but according to her Sallie Mae policy prevented her from telling me the exact balance on that day. That is quite obviously just another way to give the customer the run around.So, I had my wife call. She got a different representative who told her that the exact balance was $12,514.12 but the check would have to be for $12,521.02 because of the time to process. He then gave my wife the $14 run around if she paid the bill online. So, we tried to pay the bill online. Three time the website failed to process the payment. We called back and got a third representative. This one told us that the current balance was $12,540. Almost $20 more and of course we got the whole save $14 if you pay online routine. She asked why the guy that we talked to less than 10 minutes earlier gave us a different number. Hem... Haw... Hem... Haw... The third representative told us that the second representative must have calculated with the 3 day fee.Well yeah! We were trying to pay the bill the same day. Of course wanted to pay the lower amount. He recalculated and the new number he gave us was $12,519.40. I'm not sure why we got 3 different numbers and it worries me after dealing with this company for the last few years. I will watch online to make sure everything goes through. To the very end though, anyone reading this should be aware that this company will attempt to get every penny they can out of you. And, they will use means that are deceptive.Unfortunately, my wife's federal loans have now been transferred to Sallie Mae. It has been 3 months and I haven't gotten a bill. I am about 8 months ahead of schedule on those payments and true to form Sallie Mae has a policy that says they will not send a bill if the payer is ahead of the payment schedule. I know this because I called and asked for a monthly bill. This, quite obviously is just a way for this company to try and get people to pay more money. This policy seems like it should be illegal. As well, the hidden insurance fees on the private loan seem like they should be illegal too. I just hope that they cannot apply these same type of fees on the federal loans. Anyway, student loans are no fun. However, they are a necessary evil. If I had to do this again I would avoid Sallie Mae if at all possible. From everything I've read, this company is criminal. Hopefully, something can be done about it."
2013-11-25 20:27:44,"New York, NY",D. M.,1.0,"I have had two disasters with Sallie Mae this year. I have 7 student loans serviced by Sallie Mae, all on the Income Based Repayment plan. Additionally, I am enrolled in the auto-debit program - my payments are debited of my Checking account automatically every month. Several months ago, I closed my existing Checking account, and opened a new one with another bank. I updated my account information on the Sallie Mae website accordingly; however I later realized that my payment for that month was not auto-debited as normal. Contacting Sallie Mae customer service, I was told that my auto-debit was cancelled completely when I switched banking accounts, and that I needed to re-enrol in the auto-debit program entirely. However, I received no notification of cancellation, and there was no information provided during the account update process stating that my auto-debit services would be cancelled by switching my bank account.Sallie Mae said I needed to make a payment over the phone in order to avoid my payment being considered ""late"". They said the payment would be applied ""instantly"" over the phone, whereas if I made it online it would take 2-3 business days to clear. As my monthly payment is actually split between 3 different loan payment groups, I confirmed that the total amount I was about to give them over the phone would be correctly applied as normal to the 3 payment groups. They said, of course. The payment still took 2-3 business days to clear, so it was still not considered to be an ""on-time payment"". Additionally, the full amount I paid over the phone was applied to only one loan payment group, overpaying that set of loans and causing the other two sets to still be in delinquent status. I had to pay those two manually. More importantly, I am also stuck with one additional ""on-time payment"" I need to make at the end of the life of my loan, in order to qualify for the 25-year forgiveness benefit of Income Based Repayment.Recently when I reapplied for Income Based Repayment (as I must do every year, to re-calculate what my following year's payments will be based on my earnings), I received correspondence stating that my application had been approved, and detailing the new monthly payment amount, as well as when my first payment would be under the new amount (November 18th, 2013). Instead, Sallie Mae debited my account for the new, higher amount one month early (October 18th). The first time I called customer service (10/18) they said there was nothing they could do to stop the in-progress payment, and that I had to wait for the payment to fully clear before they could issue a refund. I called back a few days later (10/22) after the payment was cleared - the service rep said it was indeed a mistake on their end, and the new payment amount should not have gone into effect until November 18th as stated. After waiting on hold for about 20 minutes, the service rep said that his supervisor had approved a refund for the difference in payments, and that I would receive the refund in ""7-10 days"". He asked how I would like to be paid back, and I said via credit to the account the money was debited from (my checking).Two weeks later (11/5) I called back, having not received the refund in the specified time. During that call, I was told that the refund had not been approved until November 1st, and that I would receive the refund in 7-10 days from THAT date. On 11/15 I still had not received the refund and called once again. This time the rep told me that it was not 7-10 days, it was 7-14 days. He also stated specifically that these were ""business days"" (the other reps did not say this, though I had assumed as much and taken that into account when quoting them on dates). When I asked why the other reps quoted me 7-10 days, he could not give me an answer, he just kept repeating that it was 7-14. I also asked him to email me written correspondence confirming that the refund was approved, on what date, etc. and he refused to do so.I called once again on 11/22, 15 business days after the refund was supposedly approved. This rep said that Sallie Mae was still working on it. I told him that at this point I did not believe I was getting the refund, as I had received no written confirmation of such, and every service rep was giving me a different story. This rep responded by saying that he was ""CERTAIN"" that my refund would be returned to my bank account no later than the following afternoon (Saturday, 11/23). I asked him how he expected me to believe this when Sallie Mae had failed to meet every other quoted date - his response was that he would ""bet his job on it"". I then asked to take the customer satisfaction survey offered at the end of all calls, and he instead hung up on me. Today is Monday, 11/25/13 and I have still not received the refund. I have received no official detailing my refund, and every customer service rep has either lied or been unable to help. It is unbelievable to me that Sallie Mae has the legal right to overcharge my account without any recourse."
2013-11-22 18:59:07,"Marrero, LA",A. B.,1.0,"I've recently finished my undergrad degree and fortunately I was able to obtain a decent job. I began my loan payments prior to entering my repayment window... Leave it to Sallie Mae to make this difficult. I have 2 loans with SM (1 subsidized fed and 1 unsubsidized fed). Both have 7.25% interest rates, so I am very adamant about paying them off ASAP. I called to make an over-the-phone, lump sum payment that should be applied only to my unsubsidized loan. The first rep I spoke with got all the details correct... I know because the electronic check cleared my bank with all the right details in the memo. Everything after that has been a disaster! First, I waited almost week and the funds had not posted to my SM account but it was surely gone from my checking account. I called and the rep tried convincing me that there was a system issue on Nov 14, 2013 (the date I requested my phone payment) that for whatever reason prevented ALL payments from processing and that I should fax a copy of my bank statement to prove that the funds had cleared... Absolutely Not! I explained that the burden is now theirs and not mine and that I would rather not be inconvenienced any more by their internal issues. After a long, intense discussion the rep put me on hold and apparently spoke with a supervisor. She then told me that I did not need to send my bank statement and that the issue will be handled by her manager. The very next day, Nov 21, 2013, the funds posted to my account, but not the way I requested.Instead of the funds being applied solely to my unsubsidized loan, they were split between both. I called customer support about the issue only to be told that the reps are not able to apply the funds as I specified because I have a 'Smart Option' Loan (or something like that)... Needless to say, the rep could not explain to me what that meant and because I have to work to afford these loan payments I dropped that issue (for time's sake) to return to the bigger problem. She stated that my request would have to be forwarded to a different dept to be handled and should be resolved and reapplied correctly within the next 5-14 business days.This many errors with one payment is messed up on so many levels. It seems like they are purposely trying to lessen the payments I put towards my interest-bearing account and it has become a drain on not only my financial resources but also my time. I am paying interest on loan amounts I have already paid and the time that I spend monitoring and correcting their mistakes is annoying at best. These practices are nothing short of robbery... I'm being charged interest on balances that should not exist and there is absolutely no recourse for it. Something told me to process a normal monthly payment online and luckily I did because I'm sure their process for penalties on my part is much less error prone."
2013-11-22 17:32:39,"Portland, ME",TheHSIHP,1.0,"I just posted yesterday. Here is a PERFECT example of their ineptitude. Even though I have had a direct payment come out of my account for 2 private loans for over a 1 year with my current bank, one of them didn't go through this month. I called them and they had to reason as to why and my bank didn't know either. Sallie Mae had the correct account # and routing #. So I called them to reapply the payment and guess what? They apply it to the wrong loan. Idiots. So I have to call them yet again for one of their mistakes, get transferred 3 times and THEN I literally had to explain what happened at least 5 times. She was condescending the entire time trying to disprove what I was saying. Finally, she realizes that I'm right and goes about the process of fixing it which of course is like another 10 minutes on the phone. I called back today to make sure that this is being processed and again had to explain myself all over again. I then asked once again if my bank info is correct and she said she couldn't find that out for me and transferred me... and of course, I had to hold for 10 minutes. I hung up, I can't take it anymore. I will call later to get that info. They are the worst, worst, worst."
2013-11-22 15:54:33,"Saint Robert, MO",Dennis,1.0,"My issue is the Language and wording on their documents. I understand how they do the daily accrue of interest. Issue is, dont use terms like payment due date or payment amount, because it makes you feel like most other loans that as long as you pay on time you will be ok. When in fact the most important thing is to know what the math problem is and know, that even if you pay more than the PAYMENT AMOUNT that it won't go towards the principle. If you made the payment before, early and now add more days to the math problem.So besides them not contacting me back after writing emails, and on the phone asking for supervisors my biggest issue is the small sentience explaining how much interest will be charged on each payment is the most important thing to know. The rest for the language will give you false feelings because it is not like a home/car or any other loan. Pay early, often and keep record because the principle won't go down unless you do and if your principle amount does not go down you pay more interest."
2013-11-20 18:08:27,"Portland, ME",TheHSIHP,1.0,"I must say that it's refreshing (and sad) that my experience echoes so many other's on this site. I had to put my loans in deferment/forbearance for years and understood what that meant. What I didn't know was how hard it would be to deal with them once I started paying them. The amount of time I have spent on the phone with them for THEIR mistakes is truly astonishing. The amount of stress and worry that comes with dealing with this company is bar none. As others said, I would set something up with them only to be told that this isn't the case and that there is no record of that conversation ever happening. I don't have the time or energy to get into specificsIt would take forever. My advice would be to harass them like they harass us. Call them often to make sure that your plan is set up correctly especially if you make any changes. They WILL not do it right the first place. You have to keep on them. Obviously this shouldn't be the case but it is. How they get away with this gross misconduct is beyond me. Like others said I am convinced they do so in order to keep us indebted to them. They are beyond shady and I have told them so on many occasions."

My credit rating has suffered and all I am trying to do is keep his accounts current. After many calls and emails on my part, the payment is finally credited and corrections are made (which I can never be sure of how fair or accurate these ""adjustments"" are).

To this day, I do not remember EVER even getting the loan - I thought all of my loans were federal. I must admit that it is definitely on me that I did not pay closer attention - all I knew was that I wanted my Master's degree. Now I have it and a job paying a measly $11.50 an hour, minus taxes, the little bit of money I painstakingly contribute to my retirement fund, and health insurance, and that is supposed to help provide for a family of four yet Sallie Mae thinks I should be paying them $1200+ a month. They call EVERY hour, multiple times, and have ignored a cease and desist letter. I am sending another one certified mail TOMORROW. I have been paying them around fifty dollars - that is MORE than I can afford. I am confused as to how what they do is even legal."

2013-11-11 06:40:07,"Denver, CO",Holly,1.0,"I submitted a complaint about this company a month ago on this site and now I have a newer (and even bigger one). Sallie Mae has been nothing but trouble since the day I took loans from them. They never honor their end of the communications agreement and harass me almost every day (against my lawyer's explicit advice) over money I have told them a thousand times I don't have. The beginning of this month, they sent me another letter demanding another huge sum they knew perfectly well I didn't have (because I am still on SSI/SSDI). I called to reason with them about paying an affordable monthly sum ($34.32), which I could afford. However, the site wouldn't cooperate when I submitted the payment, so when I called to ask them if the payment went through only one time because I needed to pay my other bills and get food, they lied and said it did. Plus, on top of that, they tried to charge me again (which I just found out) for that same sum (which is a total of three times) and another fee of $50. They were successful in taking out not only the $34.32 I agreed to, but also the additional $34.32 and the $50 that I DID NOT agree to. Now I have a $103 overdraft in my account and the bank is threatening to shut it down for good unless I can come up with the replacement by Friday. I don't know what I am going to do. It seems the more I try to work with this horrible company, Sallie Mae, the more it turns into a nightmare and bullying monster full of greed and insensitive to compassion and understanding. It is like dealing with the corporate executives of Wall Street, who are blinded by their greed and don't care about the sufferings they inflict on their fellow citizens. I am getting really stressed out in the paralyzing rush to save my bank account from extinction and from my credit being ruined again by Sallie Mae's insensitive ""mistake"" and I don't see any alternative than to go talk to a friend of mine who is a banker. Since Sallie Mae misleads everyone by pretending to care about their customers while leaving them hanging, this company should be put out of business."
2013-11-09 08:05:31,"Towson, MD",D.,1.0,"Refinance with another Lender ASAP. Oh my GOD! These people... Hello>! ? I have a student loan and I have been abiding by the guidelines since day one and trying to keep my credit clean, but all of a sudden since 2010, there was nothing but LIES, LIES, and More LIES. I have a lot to say, but I am going to try to keep this short, considering the amount info. I am going to post about my personal experience with Sallie Mae as short and sweet.They do not go by the original guidelines and change the rules as they go. Save Your Paper work! Anything they send you for every payment arrangement and what they confirmed was okay to do. Save those Sallie Mae Letters of confirmations! As I understood it, the IBR program suppose to calculate your monthly income based on how much you make annually and then an outcome of the minimum monthly payment is calculated. I make 0 dollars a month and unemployed. I have the education, but dang it, no experience = NO JOB! I'm in the hole with Sallie Mae. What do I do? GO online and sign up for an IBR and was qualified for 1 year of $0/month based on my income.All of a sudden, in 8 months, I get a later saying that my payment is due for $X amount of money. WTF? I thought it was 12 months before I have to reapply again for the IBR Program. I can't find my paperwork stating it was 12 months. I scramble and then I quickly apply for IBR again with enough time to get a quick evaluation since resubmitting the same income tax paperwork from the 2011 were submitted... Again. I mean, they already have the info and nothing has changed. Tax Season deadline is 4/15 annually.So I submitted my application just in time to be considered and I received a letter saying that my payment is now due on such and such a date. But dang, my IBR should have expired so quickly and my registration should have gone thru. I then get a letter saying that there is a slight delay on my application for IBR. So with enough due time I apply for the Financial Hardship Deferment. Documents submitted. I then get a letter saying that my IBR application has been accepted, that my monthly payment is $0/month for 9 months. Okay, so I thought the rule of thumb here is for 12 months. Now they have that in writing and I am saving it.When IBR first was introduced, it was a 12-month program, but Sallie Mae has been able to make it into a 4-month, 6-month, or 9-month program so they have a chance to catch you off guard and make you pay what you can't pay, even though you have the same tax records in 2013 as in 2012, it would only be logical for them not to have you reapply for IBR in the same year. WTF!>?Now I am late with a payment and they say that if the IBR was approved after your date due of $0/month, I am still responsible for that payment due of $360 that month regardless of income ($360 not bad, I just don't have it). I still have to pay it even though I am a $0/month qualifier and they are trying to make me rob bank so I pay them and maintain my credit. Stay Away from Sallie Mae."

She didn't ask any financial questions or about my situation, just asked me if my co-signer could make payments. I know I owe and would like to make payments, if I didn't care I would not be calling.

No one got back to me, life goes on and I assumed all was taken care of. Now I get an e-mail to say that I owe $600! I know in comparison to what other people are dealing with this is a small amount and I should just pay it off. But I am so frustrated with having to pay for the consistent failures of Sallie Mae! And seriously, I try to be respectful and patient, but I'm from Hawaii and am used to a lot of different accents, but I can't understand a thing they are saying! Just boiling my blood even more!

During the first year when you are in deferment I made payments anyway thinking I was helping myself pay down my balances. Come my graduation and I start receiving the statements I realized my balance bounced up to over 35,000 and I had BEEN MAKING PAYMENTS!!! Over 250 a month. I call them only to be told that they absorbed it into interest!!! Now I checked off their stupid boxes on their payment slip that stated apply to principal. They told me on the phone it doesn't matter because I did not CALL in to set up a principal payment plan. I was FUMING!!!! So goes now my payments from them are almost 500 a month. After about 2 years my school goes belly up and closes. So NOW not only do I OWE Sallie Mae but now my schooling was WORTHLESS!!!! So I go through a lawyer whom I knew. We tried to attack them for over a year. WORTHLESS!!!! They would NOT disclose any financial records about where or HOW my payments have been applied, interest records, capitalized interest, king compound interest, adjustment interest, account maintenance fees, etc. These are just a NUMBER of different fees and charges that I have been charged for over the years. I have paid so far to them almost $40,000!!!! I still owe 28,000!!!! HOW THE HELL IS THIS LEGAL!!! I cant do it anymore. Between regular inflation rates, pay cuts at work, property taxes, mortgage, etc. Im falling behind on everything.

2013-11-02 00:23:58,"Anytown, CA",Kari,1.0,"I withdrew from my Master's program for a 6-month break. I knew my undergrad loans would be in repayment within a month or two. As soon as I confirmed the National Student Loan Database had reported my withdrawal to Sallie Mae, I called them to make payment arrangements - WEEKS before I received a bill. I spent at least an hour on the phone with 2 different operators discussing repayment options and the status of my loans. I was told my Sallie Mae loans (not private, but federal loans sold to Sallie Mae) are what are due now, and ALL my other Dept of Education loans would be in grace period until early 2014. I had them set me up for auto-pay for a monthly payment I could afford that would cover all the currently due loans. I asked REPEATEDLY if I would need to worry about ANY other loans coming into repayment before the grace period ended in 2014. I was told except for my private loan, no I would have no other loans to worry about. And as far as the private loan's concerned, I'd get a repayment notice well in advance of the due date so I could make arrangements for the private loan. Great, right?So my first payment comes out in October fine and dandy. A week later I get two separate billing statements with due dates different from my auto debit date. I call Sallie Mae to ask what the statements are for. The recording says my auto debit payment is 40 bucks more than what I agree to pay AND that the payment is due 2 weeks later than the date I agreed to! I get to the operator and she says, ""Oh, that payment is for your DEPT OF EDUCATION LOANS, because some of them ARE IN REPAYMENT. And by the way, your payment for those loans is PAST DUE."" WHAT THE FLYING **?!?!?What was the freaking point of calling and making payment arrangements in advance if you're not being forthright about my loan activity Sallie Mae? Plus I'd signed up for electronic letter notification and got the statements in the mail. What if I'd moved or not gotten regular mail? That's why I asked for PAPERLESS STATEMENTS. Did you not want me to know I had another bill this month, Sallie Mae? That would make it so much easier to slap me with late charges, after all.Anyway, I asked for everything besides what I'm paying to be put in forbearance until all the rest of the loans are due. I agree to the script, hopefully that settles it. But wait, there's still the private loan.... which is due in two days, by the way. Where the ** was my advance repayment notice for that? Had I not called I wouldn't have even known it was due. Of course if I want a forbearance on that it'll be 50 bucks, like it's so easy to come up with 50 bucks in 2 days.I freakin' HATE this company. I want to do the right thing and pay back what I borrowed in good standing. This company's dead set on tripping me up with omitted information so I can get into default. Just make the debt noose around my neck a little tighter why don't you? I'm trying to do the right thing here and they're giving me half-assessed information. I'm the one who has to pay for that negligence. All I asked was to make sure what I arrange will cover everything. Some of you have had a far worse experience than mine already. This agency seems to have made headway for a lot of mistreated consumers: http://www.consumerfinance.gov/. I recommend going there and filing a complaint. It can't hurt.

HOWEVER, upon checking it at one point, Sallie Mae had dinged my credit saying my account had been over 30 days late AFTER my forbearance was in place. I had a banker tell me that they should not have and had no business putting it on my credit report because it did not apply! Additionally, whenever I have called Sallie Mae, I swear I'm talking to a foreign country - foreigners. Cannot understand them and they appear to become confused. Put you on hold, come back with some answer that makes you feel like you are NOT getting a truthful answer. My daughters know NOT to ever use them.

Sallie Mae is required to send you the forms, which they do, but they don't provide a return address to send it to! When I go online and request the address, it takes them over a week to respond but it really doesn't matter because they still ""never receive it"".

I paid them late one month but the monies were there when I received a phone call from them. When I told the caller that I paid, she said she did not see it. I again told her that I paid... Her answer to me, ""I wouldn't be calling you if you paid"". I asked to speak with a supervisor and he explained it takes a couple days to show up. I regret daily that I ever got involved with doing business with this company."

I have my bank automatically send payment and have not changed a thing for 10 years. Some time this summer, Sallie Mae changed my account numbers. I got a delinquency letter at the end of August. Upon receipt, I sent an additional payment to Sallie Mae via my bank which again went to my old account number. I called on 8/22 to find out what happened and they told me about the account number change and promised to reallocate my payment to the correct account. Long story short, have spoken to Sallie Mae 10 times since and I keep getting collection calls from Sallie Mae and just got a call from a collection agency. Have to believe that there are many people in my same position. If we can get enough people together, maybe we can file a class action lawsuit."
2013-10-03 16:43:44,"Allegan, MI",Mary,1.0,"Sallie Mae holds two loans for my daughter's college education. She set up automatic withdrawal out of her bank account to pay them monthly. They helped her do this. Unbeknownst to her, they refused to take the payments and reversed them after taking them because she wasn't current on her monthly payments at the time. They would take them out sporadically and then stopped. They ultimately pushed her into default. We contacted them to try and make sense of what was happening and see what we could do and they told her they no longer hold her accounts and would have to talk to the collection agency. A month went by and suddenly she has had two payments pulled from her checking account from Sallie Mae. When she called today, they told her she had FOUR LOANS!! This is not the case. We cannot get the same information from any person there and they refuse to let us speak to a manager... They told us to go online to see our four loans and when we tried, it told us our account is suspended and we no longer have viewing capabilities... We can't even see what the four loans are to argue that they aren't ours!! What is going on and who do we get a hold of to help us here... She did everything to pay on these loans and do what she is supposed to and nothing is right on their end! We are totally helpless!! If anyone can advise where we go from here, it would be greatly appreciated. We are in a panic!! Sallie Mae is an absolute nightmare that we cannot wake up from."
2013-10-03 01:56:13,"Freehold, MD",Kristina,1.0,"This company deserves no stars. Nothing in my life has been more aggravating than this company. When my loans went into repayment after I graduated, I consistently paid them on time, but I ALWAYS had a $1 late fee on my account every single month!! I had auto debit and the payment was NEVER late. No matter who I talked to on the phone, they had no answers. They just gave me the same ** written answers that came up when they entered in what my problem was. Then, one day when I had finally had it with almost a year worth of these late fees, I asked for a supervisor. I was on hold for 45 minutes. A supervisor finally came, who of course, said there was no late fee even though it was on every bill I had and calculated into my payment due. I got angry and asked to speak to someone else. I was put on hold for another THIRTY minutes (I am not exaggerating. I worked in Philly at the time and took the train all the way back to the NJ shore, 1.5 hours away). I got on the phone when I got on the train and was still on the phone when I got home. This issue was never resolved. I was going back to grad school at this time, so my loan went into deferment anyway and I forgot about Sallie Mae. Until now.I am still in school and received a bill stating that I have a payment due TWO DAYS AGO! The envelope was postmarked SIX days ago. I'm sorry Sallie Mae, but you guys are **. How am I supposed to pay a bill on time when you don't send it on time? Why am I paying my loan when the status is deferred?? If you want to enjoy the rest of your life, DO NOT TAKE A LOAN OUT FROM THEM!!!!!!!! The first thing I'm doing when I graduate is consolidating my loans for the sole reason of getting the hell away from these jerks."
2013-10-02 18:02:13,"New York, NY",l,1.0,"Today I called Sallie Mae to say I will not be able to make payments for the new few months due to unexpected health insurance bills. Instead of working out a lower payment plan with me for the next few months, this was their resounding advice: first, ask your co-signers to pay your minimum (not an option for more). Second, use your forbearance. I cannot use this option since you can only use up to 12 months for the lifetime of the loan and I used that already in the past.The final option is you get behind on payments and THEN they will try to work out a payment with you. When I asked them how they can help me now, ahead of it being a problem, they just repeat options one and two I mentioned above. This is the worst company to ever deal with. I have been paying my loans on time for 10 years with the exception of forbearance right after college and during a time I was laid off. There is only a plus side to them postponing full payments so why not just work with your lendees? I can't believe they rather their clients default and get behind than be fiscally responsible and work with them on payment options during difficult times."

She is going thru divorce and custody issues and has no job to pay her loan. We have paid $622.00 since May 26 and Sallie Mae claims they didn't receive the money. The checks cashed and still they claim they didn't receive the money. They have the notes that were attached to the cashiers checks but claim they didn't receive the check. They will not try to resolve the issue even though we have sent them copies. The bank faxed them copies and we have sent them copies. They will not look to try to resolve this matter and late charges keep adding up and they will not do anything to stop any of it. Help please someone we have to pay another $75 October but afraid they will claim to not receiving it either.

A year later they transferred it to SM and when I received the notice I saw a balance on the one I consolidated for $125,000? I called SM and they informed me to contact the Dept of Ed. For another year, I called every month for an update. The Dept of Ed informed me that a double balance was sent to SM and paperwork was put in to change this. When I called back in Jan of this year the rep told me my file was in archive and nothing was never submitted? I then started calling SM to inform them again and they said nothing could be done and maybe I should go look at the NSLD to see my loan amount? I finally got so fed up I contacted an ombudsman and he is even having a hard time getting SM to send him my original loan paperwork. I have everything from day one. I am a hoarder when it comes to my loans. But what I do not understand is why the Dept of Ed not going after them to get their money back??? Something fishy is going on. My next step is getting a lawyer due to the fact my paper work shows something different and I have call logs with SM and Dept of Ed and what was discussed. I will start working soon and if I have to take one class a semester for as long as I live because I am not paying that until it is fixed. This has been going on for two years and I cannot take it anymore. Is there anything I can do? This is fraud."

I was on a pay based on your income and now they are trying to charge me over $680.00 a month. I am a single Mother of four children and my loans are more than my income. Every time I try to get it resolved, I get a different person with a different reason why my loans are not income-based. I send in the required information, call them, and they tell me they have to review it. Then I get a letter saying I am in default. What happened to trying to work with the students to pay their loans. I am not refusing to pay them. I just cannot afford the amount."

I received no notice of this until years later when the outstanding loans were taken over by Sallie Mae. I paid Sallie Mae in full, and two weeks after the final payment, starting getting phone calls from them stating my account was 48 days overdue for the same original amount due. After continuous phone calls to them, asking them for a straight answer on their math, I am either told they don't have the answer or am disconnected (and the latter has happened several times).This is very simple - amount+interest due. I have paid my dues for earning my college degree and Sallie Mae is not going to jerk me around anymore. Sadly, even when I do get a direct answer from them, the damage done to my credit from their claim that my loans are delinquent and remain unpaid can't be fixed so easily."
2013-09-25 14:15:00,"Homer, NY",Leslie,1.0,"Our 21-year-old daughter has a Sallie Mae ""Smart Option"" (I put this in quotes because it has clearly been one of the stupidest options we've ever chosen) student loan, for which my husband is the co-signer. She graduated in Dec '12. While she was in school, we had $25/month payments auto deducted from our bank account. SM started deducting the full payment amount from our account only three months after she graduated. The info for the loan clearly states that there is a 6-month grace period. I emailed SM about this and got absolutely no useful info. My daughter called and asked why she didn't get the full 6-month grace period, and was told that, the way the loan works is, if the $25 monthly payments are being made throughout the student's time in school, they don't give the grace period. Huh???In July '13, my husband and I made an $8k lump sum payment toward her loan to reduce her principal, also assuming that this would significantly lower her monthly payment (you know what they say about assuming...). When it didn't lower her payment, she called in Aug. '13 and explained that she couldn't afford the full payment (and she's one of those rare college grads who found a job in her field right away - it just doesn't pay a lot). She asked if her payment amount could be reduced, particularly since that $8k payment had been made the prior month. She was told no. Practically in tears, she asked to speak to a supervisor. She told her story again. The supervisor told her what they could do is credit that $8k toward future payments, so her monthly payment due would show $0 until that lump sum was exhausted. She could still make monthly payments in amounts she could afford, which she fully planned to do, since she is very responsible about her credit score. She was told it would take about two weeks for this amendment to go through, and that when it did, she'd receive a letter, in addition to having it reflected on the SM website. That was the first week of Aug '13.With her Sept. '13 due date approaching, and still no amendment after three weeks, she called again. The rep told her that oh yes, he saw that request in the system, didn't know why it hadn't gone through yet, he's going to expedite it. Check the website in two business days, and the change should be reflected. Three business days later, still no change. She called yet again. This rep appeared to go the extra mile and actually go to a supervisor and have her do the expediting magic as our daughter sat on hold. She was then told that the supervisor put it through, give it two business days, and it should be reflected on the website. Can you guess where this is going? I bet you can. Again, we gave them an extra day, and sure enough, after three business days, still no change.On Sept 13, my husband called, as the co-signer. He asked immediately to speak with a supervisor, relayed the entire situation to her, and was told it would be adjusted in - you guessed it - two business days. My husband told them that if this weren't resolved at that point, we would be taking a loan from another institution for the sole purpose of paying the SM loan in full, and we would be gratified to have them lose out on all that interest, after they've put us through this runaround. As of today, Sept. 25, there is still no amendment. My husband did receive a voice mail from SM, but when trying to return the call, has been unable to get through to a human being. Earlier this week, we submitted a loan application to a local credit union. Getting rid of this Sallie Mae nightmare will be cause for celebration. I have NEVER experienced this level of terrible, unresponsive, dare I say, dishonest customer ""service."" They have caused a tremendous amount of unnecessary stress for our daughter as she has simply tried to do the right thing and pay her student loan as she embarks on adulthood. Shame on Sallie Mae for making that so difficult for her."

And with the few hundred that they didn't lose, they misapplied the payments to the wrong loans. I have sent them copies of my bank statements that shows that the correct amounts were taken from my bank (payments that I set up from Sallie Mae's website). I have called every week and wasted at least an hour each time I have called. At first they blamed me for the mistake. I was the one that needed to prove to them that the money was gone from my account. After sending copies of the bank payments, I have been told that the problem will be fixed before my next payment is due and that all fees would be removed. 3 weeks later it is still not fixed."

However, two things have happened. First, the ""ten day payoff calculator"" disappeared from the pages for my loans I'm paying extra towards. Second, they have been misapplying my payments from the loans I'm targeting for payoff and putting that money towards other loans. When I called to have the payment applied correctly, I was told I mailed the payment to the wrong place, so it's my fault. I've been sending payments to the same address for years. The foreigner on the phone had an attitude and told me it would take over two weeks for them to adjust the application of my payment. Seriously, this is just a few mouse clicks. It doesn't take two weeks. But I guarantee I won't be credited that additional interest that is accruing on the balance that should have been lower if the payment had been applied correctly. I suspect they monitor borrowers attempting to get loans paid off and impede them in any way they can. Beware."
2013-09-21 21:40:46,"Simpsonville, KY",james,1.0,"I got my loan with Sallie Mae in 2008. I let my father do the paper work because I was a simple man with a simple mind being fresh out of high school. Five years later, I'm apparently still a simple man with a simple mind, because I can't understand how anything works with this company. I put a loan into forbearance for three months, yet I have four times the usual payment from each month. This is no problem. Like I said, I'm a simple man with a simple mind, so I went looking for a full break-down of the charges I had accrued during my forbearance. I had hoped that perhaps my own memory was wrong, if only for simplicity's sake, but I can't find a single way to access any information on previous charges.Further, the customer service phone line seems to be just as confused as to the information on the site as I am. For instance, when I tried to apply a payment to a specific loan, it was split between two loans, pushing both to become delinquent. We both spent fifteen minutes talking through the issue until we came to the conclusion that that was the case. I presently urge all graduates (and any readers) to avoid dealing with Sallie Mae if at all possible. This company purposefully engages in shady tactics to add penalties to borrowers. My advice is to use any other loan agency because I cannot fathom a greater degree of inadequacy in a company."

So I asked them to send me a letter explaining that it is only 1 account not 2 as they reported to the bureau so I could present the letter to my lender to explain the situation. But for some reason they said they don't mail any explanation letter but just a statement of the account. But it is not what the bank wants. They want a letter explaining about the 2 accounts that was on the report, so I asked them again if they could mail me a letter correcting their mistake but they won't and said it's their policy not to send any letter but statements only, even if they make the mistake."
2013-09-17 18:34:53,"Orlando, FL",F,1.0,I was asked to submit enrollment verification for the period that Sallie Mae defaulted my loan while I was still in school. I even offered to settle the payment but Sallie Mae suggested to mail in the form. I emailed it twice (ccing myself) and faxed it. 2 operators confirmed receipt and to call back 2 weeks later. 2 weeks later the operator denied receiving it and to call back in 48 hours. Now I am in default for over 110 days while I was trying to resolve this when Sallie Mae claimed less than 90 day default. Not sure what to do.

Three years ago I called and made payment arrangements because I could not afford the monthly payment they wanted me to pay. I faithfully paid on those arrangements. However, I received delinquency notices as well. I was so confused. I called and spoke to them several times with the same response, ""We see no payments made."" Even on the same day it was taken from my bank account.I am now delinquent because I didn't want to pay someone else's loan and I really feel my hands are tied. I am a single mom and can't afford this nonsense. The same happened to my mother. She actually paid her loan off, then got delinquency notices and ended up paying $16,000 in loans again. Something needs to be done about the shady business dealings of Sallie Mae."
2013-09-11 14:20:16,"Media, PA",Michael,1.0,"I have been faithfully paying my loans monthly via auto-debit for years. I recently opened a joint account with my partner and wanted to update my account information to reflect a change in auto-debit. I added my new bank account to my information via the website, outside the 6-day window as per the website. I called a few days later to confirm, even though the website reflected my new bank account information, and they told me they had no record of my updated information and that I actually needed to terminate auto-debit altogether and then re-enroll with new information. If that is the case, then why is ""update/modify bank account"" even an option on the website, which is apparently useless by the way. They then told me that it actually takes 10-14 days for this change to go into effect, not the 6 days as mentioned on the website, and further the auto-debit would be drawing from my old account and that I should call my bank to stop payment and just pay manually this time. My bank told me there would be $35.00 fee for them to stop payment and that the fact that Sallie Mae would mention this option without also mentioning a fee is ""ridiculous"", so I had to call Sallie Mae back AGAIN (which is a nightmare in and of itself) and they told me they wouldn't refund any sort of fee but if my account overdrafts they ""might"" refund me the money. So I had to run to the bank and deposit a check from another account which will hopefully clear before they auto-debit the account. You would think they would make it easy for people to actually pay their student loans but they almost go out of their way to make it as difficult and/or frustrating as possible. No wonder nearly everybody hates them or just doesn't pay. This corrupt and inept institution needs to just be shut down. I still can't believe they have the nerve to accept a bail out and still be so worthless."
2013-09-11 06:31:46,"Los Angeles, CA",ken,1.0,"It seems Sallie Mae's accounting department is incompetent, or they have really poor software to handle payment information. I have been paying off my loans through auto-debit for several years. My bank account information never changed. Then 2 months ago, for some stupid reason, Sallie Mae used a different routing number for my auto-debit. You can imagine, of course, that the payment did not go through because of the wrong routing number they used. I never gave them this other routing number. They pulled it from somewhere. My auto debit payment failed, and they sent me a delinquency notice, and removed my interest rate discount. They have reinstated my interest rate discount, but I'm still in the process of getting them to reimburse me for the extra interest I paid since their ** up. The level of incompetence and lack of transparency is amazing."

They charge 7%-10% on my student loans and will not consolidate them together with a lower interest rate. Side note: Sallie Mae is the only loan company they made me pay interest while I was still in school. On a few occasions Sallie Mae has taken out double payments whether I had auto payments or not. When I asked them to put the money back in my account they refused to. I had to contact my bank to report an unauthorized transaction as well as borrow $600 from my boss until it was refunded. The last time, one of my loans wasn't refunded because ""I'm sorry ma'am, but we cannot refund the double payment on this loan. We just can't.""My payments were increased this month when I was assured they wouldn't increase, and when I called to confront them they said, ""Oh sorry, she was a new employee and told you false information. You can report her if you'd like, but you still have to pay the extra $250 this month."" Once, I asked for a forbearance for my loans, and they said I would be charged $150 for each loan and could only forbear them 2 months max. I feel as though Sallie Mae tries whatever tricks they can to get the most money out of you as fast as they can. I would have never went to college if I knew I would of had to deal with this."
2013-09-05 05:35:41,"Wichita, KS",Colt,1.0,"This has to be one of the most unorganized, Mickey Mouse companies in existence. Had I known what problems with Sallie Mae would await me back in 1993 when I started school, I'd have thought twice about continuing my education. I was able to get a loan through the bank in my hometown, but within a few weeks after school started, the school loan specialist at the bank that I know and dealt with informed me my loan was bought by these jokers unknowingly until she told me. I've rued the day ever since school ended in '97. With all my expenses on top of some not-so-well paying jobs, this has been nothing more than a nuisance expense, often forcing me to fall behind on payments. I pay what I can, when I can, often paying for two months at a time a month behind.I recently became laid off and have yet to find anything or even begin to get back up. I'd messed with deferments in the past; however, I don't care to be dealing with these clowns the rest of my life so I do what I can when I am able. A month or two ago, I'd gotten automated calls from the robot Heather, telling me I needed to either call them or get on their site, two weeks straight at 8AM on Monday morning. Nothing like an automated bill collector calling first thing. I knew I was late paying, but I'd sent a payment off that weekend before the first call came, so I did nothing. The same call came the next Monday at the same time. I wasn't going to have a third week of it, I figured my payment should be there, but I tried getting on their website. I care to have as little to do with these jabronis as possible, I rarely get on their site, so I had long since lost my log-in info. I was sent a link to reset my password only to have it fail both times, causing my account to lock up.I've dealt with their nothing short of a circus act customer service before and I was reluctant to have to call them again. After about a 10-minute wait, I was transferred to a foreign gentleman I could hardly understand. I asked him why I was being harassed when my payment should've been there by now? Numerous times I was put on hold and I'm not sure how many times he told me how much I owed. This fool said nothing when I told him my account locked up because their password failed and told me my payment had yet to be received. The conversation either ended due to disconnection, or he hung up on me. Twelve hours after the fiasco with customer support, I found out I'd be getting an overdraft if I didn't get money in that day. The bank teller told me that check had cleared by the time I wasted probably a half hour listening mostly to what I needed to pay. All you'll found out by calling their customer service or take their calls is that you're either late paying, or what you owe. You'll know less after you call than you did before. They'll harass you to death, too, either with junk mail (which is usually sent back to them, sometimes even unopened) or worthless calls. I even had them, along with a collection agency, threatening me on the job. How they found out where I worked I'll never know. I wouldn't recommend anyone to these bozos, let alone kids looking to continue their education. Sallie Mae is one jumbled up, confused mess that'll make you sorry you ever got mixed up with them."

I actually have never missed a payment on anything in my life. For about two years now, I have been paying my Sallie Mae federal loan the same way every month. To be exact, 25 payments issued from Bank of America. About two months ago, I started receiving delinquency letters and phone calls claiming my account is past due. Long story short, Sallie Mae had been misapplying my payments to the wrong account number. I verified with the bank that my federal loan account number was still being written on the payments and that NOTHING has changed. Now here we are today. I have contacted Sallie Mae every two weeks for the last 2 months and they are yet to CORRECT their mistake. I get the same answer. ""This has been escalated with the finance department and they will update your account within a week."" My account is currently 75 days past due and I am sure this is affecting my credit. I have never missed one payment and am being penalized because employees can't do their job correctly. I have wasted countless hours stressing and working to get this situation resolved.

2013-08-31 00:41:04,"Castile, NY",Michael,1.0,"During 2005, I borrowed $40,000 from Sallie Mae. My wife was going to school. I had custody of my 3 kids and I couldn't afford her going to school without working. When my wife was finished, she was unable to find a job. Bills were stacking up and there was no way to get out of debt except bankruptcy. I filed in 2007 a Chapter 13 and paid back most of my loans. My federal student loans stayed the same, in fact, went down in monthly payments when my bankruptcy was finished. During My bankruptcy, I paid Sallie Mae $13,000 over 5 years. I expected my payment to them to decrease also or be about the same. I received a letter from them that my new principal was almost $68,000. They increased my loan by almost 28,000 dollars. When I called them to find out why, they simply had no answer or did not know why. They had payment plans but it was for more years or I could pay interest only. Then in a couple of years, my payments would go up. After 20 years of paying on this, I will have paid close to $200,000 on a $40,000 loan. I have no problem paying back the debt I owe but this seems almost ridiculous. Now we struggle to make all our payments each month and we are put right back in the situation again. Forget about calling them! You will be put on hold forever and cannot talk to anyone live. Also they said they would send me paperwork to argue the increase and to do different payment plans but have not received anything yet!"

To this day, I have faced constant discrimination when trying to get a paid job (both in my field and elsewhere) because people refuse to give me a chance due to ""lack of experience"" or my hearing disability. I have tried repeatedly to get a job long before the student loans were due so they could be paid back in a timely manner, but that has yet to happen.Sallie Mae refuses to acknowledge the fact that I barely get by with the meager SSI/SSDI income I get; I have had to get a lawyer (through Legal Aid because I can't afford one otherwise) and this agency has made ridiculous requests demanding that I pay what I can't afford. My lawyer has tried to reason with them several times, but they refuse to defer the private student loans, although they have deferred/consolidated the other half. Until I get a job, there is no way I can pay the ridiculous amount they demand; I have a letter drafted by my attorney, which clearly instructs them to stop harassing me by phone (and to which they agreed). As of today, I have 4 voicemails on my phone as proof that they have violated this agreement. In addition, they keep texting me and calling me when I am working at my non-paid volunteer job, which causes me to lose focus in my concentration.Sallie Mae continues to send harassing/demanding letters in the mail as well, including the ""We demand that you pay X amount"" letter, in spite of the fact that I have called them on my own numerous times and tried to explain my situation to anyone who will let me tell them. What am I supposed to do, starve so they can have money I can barely afford? I can barely pay my bills as it is and towards the end of the month, there is no food in the house and no money to get anything. Several people I have tried to reach out to have made things worse by playing the ""blame the victim"" game with me. My mom, the cosigner, doesn't have a job either and they have been ordered not to harass her either. They don't listen to this as well.I remember that one time my legal aid lawyer was on the phone with them and doing a little ""arguing back and forth."" I distinctly remember her ordering them not to call me again and getting their agreement that they would not do so. As I stated above, they have violated that agreement several times and send in ridiculous requests for money I don't have.Sallie Mae has been my worst nightmare. They never try to work with you when you tell them (until you are blue in the face) that you can only pay what you can afford, and demand in very aggressive voices that you pay what THEY want you to pay when the reality is you don't have the amount they demand for. Then they make threats to ""seize your assets if you don't pay"" and I don't even have a car. I don't have anything of value that they can seize. My lawyer said they can't even take my meager SSI/SSDI, but a debt relief lawyer I just spoke with today said they might be able to, which places more stress on me because a great majority of the funds go to food for the month and the rent I pay for this apartment by the Housing Authority (the latter also raising the amount of rent every time my SSI/SSDI goes up). In the latter's case, when the manager told me last time that I have to pay more rent, she laughed. Why is taking all my money so I can barely survive so funny?I don't know what to do about Sallie Mae. It's like talking to the wall and their customer service is terrible. It seems like all they care about is money I don't have and threatening me. They don't care about the fact that I can't find a job, no matter how hard I have tried since graduation and they don't care about the amount of stress they place on the student. If I had to do it all over again, I would start college with loans from another company that actually works with its clients. Sallie Mae blackens your credit standing for things that are not in your control and accuses you of ""refusing to pay the bill"" with money that isn't even in your bank account."
2013-08-26 19:20:35,"Colorado Springs, CO",Lizzy,1.0,"The college I went to 5 years ago went through SallieMae. If I had known how big of a headache SallieMae is I would have declined and gone through my own bank or found a loan on my own. SallieMae changes the due dates, and in order to find that out you must log in. I have had this problem more than 6 times in the past year. It's almost every other month the due date changes. This would not be a huge problem if I would get an email notification (sorry I don't obsessively log into my college loan site to check on it), but they do not. I do not even get a past due notification. Just weeks after the ""new due date"" I get a notification of new documents available for me. I have requested several times for my own scheduled due date (they give you the option to do that) too bad it's set for as long as they feel like it before they change the date on you again."
2013-08-25 17:36:52,"Quakertown, PA",L,1.0,"My son and daughter in law have tried in good faith to make payments for her student loans to Sallie Mae, but their payments are much more than they can afford. Sallie Mae refuses to take partial payments, thereby putting them into default, ruining their credit, and compounding more and more interest. It would take them the rest of their lives to pay what the current debt is now, and they would still owe money. What kind of idiocracy is this that Sallie Mae will not work with consumers and would rather get paid nothing than something? If you can't afford a large payment every month, you can't afford it. You can't squeeze someone for something they don't have. Should they live homeless on the streets so they can afford to pay Sallie Mae back? There is something drastically wrong with what this agency is doing to people - ruining their lives simply because they were stupid enough to get student aid from Sallie Mae. This place should be shut down. I know they are under investigation now."
2013-08-24 17:18:17,"Arlington, TX",Frank,1.0,"Back in 2005 I start school at The Art Institute of Dallas. I was given a Sallie Mae Loan. I had to drop out of school due to an illness. I had two loans with Sallie Mae. I finally started paying my Sallie Mae loan back through Integrity Solution Services, Inc. I was paying $55.00 a month through automatic bank withdraw, since that is all I was able to pay. In February of 2013 the payments stopped. I did not receive a phone call or a letter from Integrity or Sallie Mae. I am a disabled Veteran - it is now going on 7 months with no word from either party. I was going to purchase a home but denied because of Sallie Mae - I thought that the Sallie Mae Loan was taken care of. Today I found out that Sallie Mae took back the loan from Integrity, and when I called Integrity they told me that they did not know why Sallie Mae took the loan back because I was paying well on my loan - I still to this day have not received a phone call or letter from Sallie Mae. In addition, when I try to call Sallie Mae, I am being transferred all over and, then back to the start of the phone call. When my loan had been transferred to Integrity Solution Service I had paid my loan down to $41,367.00 but, now due to penalties and interest that Sallie Mae has added I now owe $49,000.00. This seems illegal to me. NOT one time was I made aware that Sallie Mae took my loan back - no letter, no phone call. I feel this was an attempt on Sallie Mae's side to inflate my loan and once the loan became large enough due to penalties and interest then, they would contact me for payment - I am sure when I call them on Monday and if I am able to speak to someone they will insist that they have tried to contact me even though they know good and well they didn't."
2013-08-23 21:42:24,"Tucson, AZ",Michael,1.0,"Sallie Mae repeatedly denies correspondence and conversations and the submission of documentation required for forbearance and deferment. On a number of occasions I've sent numerous forms by fax and mail in order to extend a temporary deferment and Sallie Mae will not acknowledge receipt, does not inform of the end of a deferment period or that they have not received documentation, but instead allows fees to accrue while the borrower thinks he or she is still in an active state of deferment. Judging by the nature of other people's experiences and complaints, I would have to believe that these behaviors are deliberate and part of a pattern of behavior that allows Sallie Mae to assess unwarranted fees and apply them to borrower accounts in an unethical effort to maximize profit."
2013-08-23 16:54:48,"Tucson, AZ",Mary,1.0,"Sallie Mae has the absolute worst customer service of any company I have ever dealt with in my life. I am 53 so I have been around for a while. I do not know how they can continue to get away with what I believe no other business, except maybe large banks, would be allowed. I have tried, and tried to negotiate with them. They tell me one thing, do not follow through, and then deny the communication. Their robot calls me 5-6 times a day beginning at 7:00 am and do not stop until 10:00 at night. I have asked that they not call during my work hours but I have been told that as long as I am behind in my full payments, the robot calling will not stop. I could go on, but many of you have already stated many of the issues I have dealt with. It is extremely stressful."
2013-08-22 13:20:43,"Livermore, CA",Robert,1.0,"I supported my daughter in getting a student loan through Citibank. My daughter set up the payments to automatically pay each month from her checking account. After some time (years) I received in the mail about 3 weeks ago a letter saying that my Sallie Mae student loan was delinquent and late charges have been added to the balance. I called them and after getting a message that my call would be answered in the next hour and a half would you like us to call you back, I said yes.Upon talking to a representative telling her that I didn't know that the student loan was purchased by Sallie Mae and my daughter is still making payments to Citibank. Who by the way had sent me 3 or 4 checks with no explanation. I asked the representative to give me to her supervisor because I could hardly understand what she was saying. She hung up on me. After some time I was able to reach another representative, and after giving my account number, mailing address, social security number, etc. 2 times I could finally explain the problem that I was having. I had requested that they send me a normal bill without all of the late charges because they did not notify me - I am the primary person responsible for the loan, instead they sent a payment book including a higher balance and late charges attached.I tried without success to reach a representative to straighten this out. Two or three weeks went by. As of August 14th I received a DEMAND FOR FULL PAYMENT INCLUDING INTEREST AND LATE FEES. I called them back, I reached the same person, I could not understand her. I asked for her supervisor. The supervisor would not acknowledge my problem but kept asking what my address was, phone number, etc. I told him that I gave that information several times before and had given it to the representative just before I spoke to him. He refused to acknowledge me or let me explain my problem. I told him that I am going to see a Lawyer then.My daughter also called them on the same day with the intention of paying them in full because she was stressed out as I was about the whole thing. They hung up on her and when she called back 4:30 Pacific Standard Time, and went through the menu they were closed. We were not given the opportunity to straighten this out and my credit which right now is excellent is going to be trashed. I believe that the people at Sallie Mae do not give a crap about the people and are not qualified to do their jobs."
2013-08-20 02:15:31,"Columbus, OH",Jessica,1.0,"Heres the deal, I borrowed quite a substantial amount of money from Sallie Mae during 2007-2010 for college. I had no difficultly applying, qualifying and being granted a loan year after year with no credit history or co-signer, however now that Im trying to PAY MONEY BACK its a nightmare to say the least. Ill skip the crap that lead us to this point because Im sure there are many eerily similar stories to mine.Last year I was finally able to reach an agreement with one of their representatives and was put on a rate reduction plan with just days to spare before the loan defaulted. The payment was much more than I anticipated (my income-based Federal Loan payment which is based off of my income is 1/10th of their reduced expected monthly payment) and was more than I comfortable with but I had just gotten a new job with a slightly greater income so I accepted. I wanted to do the right thing, get my accounts current and start the painstaking process of cleaning up my ruined credit. ( and put an end to the non-stop phone calls) I made it through the year long program with no issues - payments were always withdrawn on time and in full, my account was current with a solid year worth of payments. Towards the end of the initial program I received information about the possibility to extend my stay in rate reduction due to good payment history. PERFECT! Honestly, it was the ONLY way I could afford to keep in good standing so a month before my current plan ended I called to speak with a representative to set up another payment plan.Getting through to a live human is agonizing but, nonetheless I set aside an afternoon I was off work, prepped my new budget and expenses and prepared to wait. I must say that setting up the extension on the rate reduction plan was pretty easy. This time I was prepared with all my figures, we crunched numbers and the rep put me on hold to run all the information, on hold for 20 minutes, but I was prepared and had set aside plenty of time for this. She came back with my new payment, an increase from last years of course, and as I explained how difficult it was to commit to such a number out of one pay check (I get paid twice a month, and the payment was around half of one of my paychecks already) she offered up a solution of splitting my loan payments to correspond to my pay periods so Im not getting hammered out of one check. GREAT! That I can commit to, that seems reasonable - as reasonable as youre going to get from a private lender. I picked 2 dates that worked with my pay periods, agreed to auto debit from my checking account and the representative said she was sending a request to move my due dates to reflect the agreed upon payments dates - so my payments would never be late, my account would always be current. The first scheduled payment on the new plan was a month and a half away - plenty of time for changes to take place I was told.Fast forward to August 12th, 2013 - the date of my first scheduled auto payment on my new plan - and Im not seeing any activity in my checking account. Thats ok, Ill panic tomorrow if it still hasnt posted. Tomorrow comes and Im panicked because Im not seeing a payment posted to my Sallie Mae online account, Im not seeing any money debited from my checking, and I know that my account has to be in good standing to stay in this program. My boss can tell Im upset so she excuses me to make a call while Im on the clock - because their email option is a complete joke. After being on hold for 45 minutes and transferred 3 times I finally get someone that can help me. She assures me that my payment is visible on their end, that it could take 48 more hours to post to my bank account, and that my account is in good standing. 2 days later I see the payment amount is taken from my checking, with confirmation number - WHEW - that was scary!Fast forward to today, Monday August 18th, 2013. I receive an email stating I have a new document to view online - I assume its a thank you for your payment type thing so I log into my account and to my complete horror in big orange writing is a notice that reads - YOUR ACCOUNT IS 11 DAYS DELINQUENT - MAKE A PAYMENT IMMEDIATELY TO AVOID LATE FEES AND MAINTAIN THE RATE REDUCTION, ANY DELINQUENCY MAY RESULT IN REMOVAL OF PROGRAM Wait, WHAT?!? How is my account delinquent, I just made a payment, like we agreed and set up over a month ago - this CANNOT be happening! And once again, Im at work when I get the news, so I try the email option and I hear nothing after a couple hours (in fact its almost 10pm EST now and I sent that request at 11am EST and have heard NOTHING still...) I decide I have to call on my lunch break and try to get some information, I'm upset.So I call the number listed in my delinquency notice, and Im on hold - for 30 minutes - finally a live person! That cant help me, so Im transferred once, twice, three times - back to the rep that helped me set up the plan in July. Its been 45 minutes of my hour lunch at this point but Im optimistic she can resolve this. WRONG!! She explains that my due dates never got changed so my account appears delinquent and the ""reason"" my due dates never got changed because of some new processing software/program that started in July - the same month I set this all up. OK, I understand server updates but why was I not informed of this, or at least made aware of the potential for something like this to happen? A major change isnt just implemented overnight, I should have been notified in some way and now Im upset - why wasnt I made aware of the possibility of something like this?? And now, what can be done to fix this? The resolution - I can either change my payment dates to reflect the current due dates (which do not correspond with my fixed pay days, which was the reason for all this in the first place) OR she can send the due date change request AGAIN... And that it SHOULD go through this time, but they are backlogged like 20,000 people, but it should go through. Thats reassuring.So, let me get this straight - YOU have a major system flaw that was not at all prepared or accounted for - yet alone disclosed to your customers, and IM the one thats suffering? She then proceeds to tell me not worry that my account is sitting delinquent, just ignore it and check back in September. At this point Im fuming, then she adds - dont worry about your credit, we dont report until the account is 45 days delinquent and it SHOULD be cleared up before that  oh and those late fees youre seeing accumulate already, you wont be charged for those. When I inquire about receiving that in writing for my records and frankly my protection, Im told thats not possible. Sure, ok, Ill just take your word for it, just like I did back in July when I was told everything was all set up - look where that got me. She finishes with oh, and Ill make sure youre taken off the phone list too. TIME OUT - youre going to CALL me about my delinquent account thats YOUR FAULT?!? Thats IT, now Im PISSED. This isnt good enough, I need some type of resolution NOW - what can you do to remedy this? I ask. Nothing - YOU can change your payment dates OR I can re-submit the request but you will have to wait. Thats not a resolution in my opinion and when I say this to the representative she responds with well, I cant wave a magic wand  OK NOW IM DONE, I WANT A SUPERVISOR  NOW! Put on hold and transferred again, this time to a female that sounds like a teenager  and it almost seems like Im on speaker phone because Im hearing a lot of background noise, in particular giggling, which Im fairly certain no customer of Sallie Mae would be doing while engaged in conversation with their delightful representatives.I again verify my identity, explain my frustrations and am met with a scripted response - I understand, Im sorry youre so upset, how would you like to proceed..? I need this delinquency removed immediately, I dont care that it wont affect my credit, I wont be responsible for the late charges because no one can OFFER THAT IN WRITING, nor can anyone change my due dates - not without it going through this whole process that apparently 20,000 of your other customers are stuck in too. She keeps repeating her angry customer script and I realize Im getting nowhere, its now been an hour and twenty minutes Ive wasted on the phone, not getting paid, for nothing.This is absolutely unacceptable. First, the only way to contact anyone is by phone  which is an all day affair. Emails are lost in space, unanswered, and Im willing to bet not even read. The majority of their customer service representatives are mouthy, rude, and unwilling to offer any resolution. Not once were my major concerns addressed, I was only given take my word for it. Thats crap and bad business, I dont care who you are. And I dont buy for one freaking second that not one single person can manually override a payment due date in the computer, I just didnt have an afternoon to dedicate holding and being transferred a million more times to get there. Now Im sitting here looking at documents that were sent to me today which state that my account is past due and that I need to make a payment or risk removal from the rate reduction plan. Am I just supposed to ignore that too? Just wait it out until September and hope the previously agreed upon plan takes effect? And feel comfortable with their representatives word that my account is safe, that this delinquency will not negatively impact my credit and the late-fees Im seeing accumulate will be magically wiped away - as if by some magic - wait, that cant be correct.I am trying to repay this debt; I made arrangements well in advance to avoid something like this and what for? So I can spend hours on the phone while Im at my job - the job I NEED to PAY them back - to sit on hold, be transferred, treated rudely and still have ZERO resolution. Waiting it out is not an option - and frankly I DONT TRUST THEIR WORD. I'm not doing this again in September arguing late charges and seeing hits to my credit - the credit Ive worked so hard to start rebuilding. I will not be pushed around and I will not accept waiting as a resolution - this is THEIR ERROR. The fact that the company did not account for this possibility is not my problem. The fact that it wasnt disclosed as a possibility to their consumers in advance or once it was confirmed there could be some issues is not my problem. My account has been paid to those agreed terms and should not be sitting in delinquent status. It is appalling that their response is - dont worry about it, ignore it, wait it out even though the notices and the late fees keep mounting. This is affecting customers that are all too familiar with delinquency and late fees - the ones that rely on these programs to dig themselves out of a huge hole, with hopes of restoring their credit. Ignoring their delinquency notices 2 years ago got me here, paired with the companys unwillingness to be reasonable. Im sorry I cant just ignore the bright orange message, feeling confident this company will take care of me. I deserve better than that but unfortunately I cannot expect it. Their track record in the resolutions department is nonexistent, this company isnt one to admit fault or offer up a solution until the bitter end. Somehow its always the customers headache. I dont want to hear the excuses, I refuse to believe there is no override and I do not accept the offered resolution of waiting it out when the documents and alerts they are sending me clearly state otherwise. ACT NOW, AVOID REPERCUSSIONS - not something I can turn a blind eye to. I will not be bullied or made a fool of and I will not accept no as an answer. My account needs reflect good standing, with due dates updated, payments to execute as planned, and all signs of delinquency removed. I think thats reasonable considering I was given ZERO information about a server update and its potential to negatively affect my repayment plan. No accountability, no customer service, and I know I'm one of many, too freaking many, with a serious complaint and grudge against this disgusting company."
2013-08-08 16:01:59,"Austin, TX",Joshua,1.0,"This Bank is a nightmare. I have all my student loans with them, biggest mistake of my life. I have no problems paying my loans and my minimum payments but they make it so hard to pay. First of all once you sign up, you are going to be spammed, 2 emails a day at least, saying nothing but ""Sallie Mae has something important and urgent to tell you. Please visit the website but due to security reasons we won't tell you anything in this email."" Then you go to the website and nothing happens, no notifications or anything telling you were to go or why they emailed you with this urgent document you needed to see. So once you get frustrated enough with the spam every day and going to the slow nightmare of a website, you will probably do what I did, just reroute those emails to spam. Which worked for the day to day, however, automatic debit does not work on the website, for some reason I do not even know why they offer it. I have signed up for automatic debit from my account the first time a logged on the website then resigned up for auto debit every month after that because it never worked. Finally on the 4th time I called into customer support to have them walk me through it, and once we were done doing exactly what I had done before to set up automatic debit they promised ""yes all your loans are automatic debit"". So I hung up and thought the nightmare was over. Well its been 3 months and every month at least one of the auto debit loans does not debit my account so I get more spam from them and a phone call of a recording saying please Sallie Mae at ""1-800-TalkToARobotForAnHourEvenThoughWeCalledYou"". I call then finally get to a customer service representative and ask why did you call, and they say, I don't know sir, what do you want? As if it is weird, and completely foreign to them that they are sending out automated calls telling people to call them for urgent account information. Anyways to add salt into the wound, to make a minimum payment it goes through immediately; however if you pay extra it takes 7-14 days at which at any point they can decide to debit your account."
2013-08-05 14:23:20,"Pittsfield, MA",Anita,1.0,"My son has a student loan through Sallie Mae. I wanted to help him out with the payments. I first called Sallie Mae to see if I could send in a check with a partial payment. I spoke to a guy who advised me that I could indeed, send in a check but that it should have my son's acct. number on the check and he also told me to attach an 8 x 10 note along with the check stating which acct. I would like it posted to. I did that and mailed it off. Sure enough, as he warned me, the check was posted to the wrong acct. (2 of the wrong accts. actually).After probably 5 phone calls to numerous reps., the check was finally posted to the correct acct. The following month, I mailed in another check, with the correct acct. number on the check as well as an 8 x 10 piece of paper stating which acct. to post it to. Again, the check was posted to the wrong acct. I again contacted Sallie Mae to inquire what happened again. I was told that I must have had the wrong acct. number on the check, that the envelopes are not opened by an actual person, blah, blah, blah and that they would fix it. I mailed a 3rd payment in. The check was cashed on July 15th by Sallie Mae but did not show up on any of the transactions. Again, I called, spoke to 2 more reps who advised me that I had to send in a copy of the bank statement to verify the info. I told them to get me a supervisor who could help me. Spoke to a supervisor, AGAIN, she advised me that I did NOT have to send in a bank statement and that she would take care of it. A week goes by, still no activity. I spoke to another rep today. She asked me the same questions that the other 15 reps asked me. I told her that I wanted to speak to a supervisor. After spending 10 more minutes on hold, I got yet another supervisor who told me that I'd have to send in a bank statement because they have no record of my check!!! I told her to pull up the phone call from the supervisor that I spoke to last week who told me that I did NOT have to send in a bank statement because she could see on her screen that the check was indeed in their system. She told me that I was given the wrong information by that supervisor!!! Okay, I am so done with this. Now I have the supervisors telling me that the other supervisors are wrong!!! Definitely doesn't give me a good feeling. I asked this supervisor what happened to my check??? It was cashed, it was in their system and it does not appear on my son's acct. She told me that ""50 dollars was a common payment and that it could possibly be attached to the wrong persons acct., or that it could have ended up in the ""bucket"" where checks go, that have the wrong acct. numbers on them!!! Imagine that???? I have my phone number on the check, the acct. number on the check and the darn check was cashed????? What the heck is up with this company???? I am now calling the Better Business Bureau to report this company. Had I know that this is how they operate, I would not have touched them with a 10ft. pole. Run, don't walk away from this company."
2013-08-02 20:52:10,"Ridgewood, NY",Stephanie,1.0,"I pay my loans twice a month for the most part, or one big lump sum once a month. I have been struggling to pay these loans off, but thankfully only have 3 to go and am very proud. However, when I logged in this month, I found that 4 of the loans that were paid off for quite some time now show up on my account again. 3 of the 4 show up as delinquent, 708 days past due. Clearly, this doesn't make any sense. I am constantly logged into the site and have never seen this before. Also, I pay thousands of dollars on these loans, neglecting 76 cents or 10 dollars doesn't make logical sense. Their resolution is to pay the delinquent difference, which I refuse to do. They say they will look into giving me a ""courtesy credit"". What courtesy???? I have paid these damn loans in full, some since 2011.Upon further research, I discover another issue. Thankfully I am extremely organized and keep track of everything. Now I see that they debited my bank account $600 (which I did authorize) and credited the Sallie Mae account...great. However, the next day, decide to take the credit back (for whatever reason) but not return money to my bank account. I have spoken to 5 different reps and all of them start with...""How would you like to make your payment of $39.98, your account is past due 708 days."" When I mention the issue of the $600 dollars, they say I am wrong and that they have credited the account accurately. No one wants to research or claim the research will take 7 days but will not listen to what I am trying to tell them.There is clearly a system glitch!!!!! Speak to your IT people for goodness sake, unless they are just blatantly trying to steal money from people. How could the system be soooooo unreliable? I know I am probably not the only person in this world with this issue. Please review your accounts in detail. This is unfair and cannot go on. I know there are some people out there that would never question their bill and innocently pay whatever is charged. This is extremely upsetting and discouraging and has to be corrected."

They did not take any money out for June which was great because they followed through. However they took money out of my account for July. I'm not sure why because my loans were put in forbearance. So I called and told them what happened and the rep said that I will be refunded my money by Friday. The last time this happened I did not receive a refund for a month and a half, called 6 times and they said they never received my fax. I was going in circle and was becoming very frustrated.

This time, not even one of the higher ups is available to talk.

I am a dislocated worker who has exhausted all of my unemployment and still seeking employment. I started dealing with Ed ** at Central Credit Services in Jacksonville, FL to try and get my account back on track (due to a divorce, bankruptcy, and foreclosure).

I contacted Ed ** on his direct line 866-394-2696 on 4/24, 5/21, 5/22, 6/27, 7/16, and 7/19 and each time he tells me ""he has me covered"" and Sallie Mae will ""fix my interest rate immediately"" and backdate the new interest rate starting May 2013. I have also been told by Ed ** Sallie Mae had a glitch in their system and he would call me back (5/22/13) in which I have never received any call backs from him nor to date the interest rate has not changed. I call every month and get the same answer and when I check on the Sallie Mae website the interest rate has not changed, nor will Sallie Mae speak to me directly but they will take the $303.09 from my account each month. I have contacted my representative for Ohio and he said to write a complaint. The private student loans need to be allowed in bankruptcy. With the high interest rate, the economy down, no jobs, Congress needs to pass the bill to allow these private loans to be bankrupt so students like myself are able to move on. Yes I do have federal loans which are not in default because they able me to pay according to my income - which is $0. Something needs to be done with these private loans. I will never recover in my life trying to pay these ridiculously high private loans. I also am not anywhere with Sallie Mae or Central Credit Services on the ""promised"" interest rate yet they keep taking the money out of my account. Please help!"
2013-07-27 11:22:41,"Orlando, FL",Dan,2.0,"Needless to say, I have multiple loans I am attempting to manage, about 16 ranging from a couple hundred to one over 10,000 - make a monthly payment of about 600$, and yes, more than half comes out as interest (graduate degree 6.8%). I am trying to pay down my loans and like to make additional payments on my lowest balance loans. When I send in the payment, they apply it across the board - most recently made a 126$ payment and a little less than 19$ went to principal - the rest to interest. I have to send them an email each time and tell them how to apply it to one specific account so that I will lower my principal down more quickly and pay less interest.Each time I send an email, they tell me it will be applied according to policy - they will eventually apply it as requested, but in the meantime, I am paying interest on the balances that have not been lowered. Then when it comes normal payment time - they do not apply the normal payment to the account that I made an additional payment on, as well as they do not even pay the interest so it keeps accruing. PS - the account that I am trying to pay down first did not have any of the 126$ payment applied to it after being spread across the board."

But when I called to talk to an agent at Sallie Mae, they asked me if I wanted to PAY $14 to do so. I said no and was disconnected! What is THAT all about? How do I get through to them?

I finally found a job (not doing what I went to school for, as there were no jobs at that time in that field) almost a year later. I got my statements to start making payments again. The interest had gone up 3,000 dollars! In one year!!! My loan was for 5,000 and in 4 yrs only went down like 1,000 dollars (total rip off)! Now my loan is almost 8 grand and they want me to pay almost 200 a month.

Since '94, these people have been a huge pain in my you-know-what. They've done everything to bother me, from harassing calls (even at my job) and emails, to junk mail. My income has caused them to become a great burden to make payments to, I do what I can, when I can. I don't care to be dealing with these idiots the rest of my life, so I am done postponing payments, waiting bimonthly to make them.Lately, I've gotten calls for two consecutive weeks telling me to get on their site. I care to have as little to do with them as possible, so I never go there. I had to reset my password, but I couldn't log in after I did, causing my account to become disabled online. I called the number, talked to a rep, but was constantly put on hold before eventually being disconnected. I'd recently made a payment last week, but they'd yet to receive it the same day. Less than 12 hours later, it'd both gone through and been received.They have poor customer service, their employees are hard to understand speaking, and they have a very unorganized Mickey Mouse operation. I deeply regret ever getting mixed up with Sallie Mae, to the point where I almost regret attending college. If you can make consistent payments, you won't have to deal with them much; however, they'll harass you at every corner if you struggle making ends meet."

My mother is my co-signer, and she is almost 80 yrs young and they call her day and night non-stop. They are not helpful. They say they can offer lower payment. This is good but I want them in forbearance so I can get caught up on all my bills, I lost my job in January and I did not go back to work until April (both were this year) and I am still getting caught up on all my bills.

I sent a message back to Sallie Mae and asked why my student loan is in repayment when I am still a full time student. I received a prompt reply indicating that my school failed to tell them I was still in school. I responded letting them know that their answer is not making sense. My year 1 and 2 loans are in repayment and the dates changed, but my year 3 and 4 loans are reflecting my correct graduation date and subsequent anticipated repayment dates. Sallie Mae keeps blaming the school and will not correct their inconsistencies. They are putting me in a position to take a private student loan to pay their loan just to keep my credit clean. Talk about setting you up for failure."
2013-07-04 15:04:25,"Ocean, NJ",Jennifer,4.0,"The same thing happened to me with the missing payments. I sent a letter to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and was directed to: US Department of Education, Federal Student Aid, Ombudsman Group, 830 First St, NE - 4th floor, Washington, DC 20002-5144. In my letter, I complained about Direct Loans selling the loan to Sallie Mae with no notice. Direct Loans had all the money sitting in an escrow account and never forwarded the money to Sallie Mae. You need to provide a list of missing payments. If you mail checks, send the front and back of the check. If you do electronic banking, I got a letter from my bank with the routing numbers and confirmation that the money was deposited to Sallie Mae. DO NOT have the bank pull the money back from Direct Loans; otherwise, your credit will be damaged the way they look at it. This is on them and their negligence.I do have email accounts and NEVER received notice by mail or email until a month AFTER my complaint was resolved. Make sure in your complaint to the Ombudsman, you request a complete accounting of all payments transferred appropriately to Sallie Mae, credit of all interest and penalties associated with their negligence in accepting the payments without forwarding to Sallie Mae, as well as evidence they have corrected your credit history profile to reflect that the payments were not late. It took about 90 days to go back and forth, but the Ombudsman was wonderful in lighting a fire under someone's backside to fix the mess they created."
2013-07-03 14:50:02,"Fort Washington, MD",D,1.0,"I wish I had visited this site before taking out my loans for my son with the thieves of thieves. I too had made my payments like clockwork and started getting the robo calls. I kept saying over and over at times screaming to the what I really thought this is a ""stuck on stupid"" person. Then one day someone called and informed me that my loans were sold off a year prior to the Department of Education by Sallie Mae. Can you imagine my surprise!? I did not get any letter of that. Then I was told I was notified by email. That was surprising because I had never gone in to open up an account on the internet. I asked how come I never received a new payment booklet from Sallie Mae or Dept. of ED. Dept. of ED said they don't use payment booklets and Sallie sent me a new one in a weeks time.So I got my bank payment records together and sent to Sallie Mae and DOE letting them know that indeed I had made payments and here's the proof. IT MEANT NOTHING!! I tried talking to anyone there that had an ear. They all had deaf ears. I now wonder if there was some kind of kickback or bonus structure that these representatives are receiving. If they see where they were wrong, then they would have to give the money back. There's something wrong there and I can feel it. I used the Dept. of Ed Ombudsmen's office - after a year of giving him the same information and he confirmed that I had been making all of my payments - DOE and Sallie Mae continued I was in breach of my contract.I have contacted both Senators, and the eloquent letters that Sallie and DOE sent back would make it look like I never paid them a dime. Never mentioned that they had misapplied many of my payments, but it was my fault that I didn't maintain my contract. I am not stopping. THERE HAS GOT TO BE SOMEONE OUT HERE IN AMERICA that cares about the scam of scam. I have one caution and please pass this on to everyone you know that needs Student Loans for their kids for fall of 2013 - cancel them. Since the interest rate has doubled because of the poor performance with Congress and the folks assuming that the rate would be retroactive - DON'T TRUST THEM. I am very sincere. Just have them wait out one semester until it is all squared away. If the rate is the same at the end of July, then cancel it or go to community college and pay a course at a time because at the end of 4 years, you will regret it. All of these bloggers are not lying when they are writing about their horrible experiences. One more suggestion - have everyone you know call their Congressional office and start reporting/writing our problems. I don't have any extra money to pay for an attorney. Heck I am making $800 payments every month and not a dime to spare. Easy to get the loans - a nightmare when you are trying to pay them off. I have left out a lot of stuff because it's too much, just too much. But I am a fighter."

2013-06-21 18:48:54,"Burbank, CA",Karmen,1.0,"Sallie Mae is a sad company. It really disappoints me how they can take advantage of their customers. I have tried on several occasions to resolve a loan, adjust payments so they are able to get their money back without making the borrower in debt and starving, but they did not accept any of the possible resolutions. Not only that, the borrower, my daughter, has a learning disability. Although 18 at the time, I am unsure if she understood the terms and repercussions of the loan. I don't blame Sallie Mae alone. I hold the Art Institute equally accountable. Both seem to prey on young adults and people in general looking to further their education and get ahead. These companies get people in debt instead of doing the opposite, promoting growth. They are a big problem for the economy and I hope that soon, their scams are recognized not just by the borrowers. Please people, do not take out a loan with Sallie Mae. You'll regret it for the rest of your life, literally. They will make sure of it."

Their student loans interest rates are over 10% and they are tenaciously hanging on to those usurious rates and will not offer refinancing, consolidation or any program that will actually help struggling students pay off their student loans!"
2013-06-17 18:55:35,"Cincinnati, OH",Stephen,1.0,"In short, we had numerous student loans with Sallie Mae, enough that we may have missed a due date for a few days at times. During that period of time, we would receive many phone calls all hours of the day, every day of the week. We would then realize which loan they were talking about and make a payment.All of the loans got very confusing, so we worked with Sallie Mae to combine ALL loans into one payment. We questioned, on several occasions, if ALL of the loans were combined. We were assured that they were. We made all payments on this new combined loan on time. We continue to make payments to this one loan on time.Months later, we found out from Sallie Mae that we have not been making payments to a loan that, to our surprise, did not get combined with the other loans. We were not making payments on that anymore because we were told they were all combined. Our record on Experian shows exactly that. There is the proof that we thought this loan was combined. When we were told that we could fill out a forbearance on this loan so that the payments could be delayed to give us time to adjust and make payments, we were told they would send us the paperwork. We received no paperwork, nor did we receive any other notice or phone call. Roxanne confirmed this with Tracey.The next we heard from PHEAA was that the loan was in default, with a balance of $41,491, which was due immediately. If we could not repay immediately, we had approximately 75 days; then, a $9,000 fine would be added to our loan. They contacted us on around 15 days into the 75 days.We called Sallie Mae back and ended up talking to a specialist to ask what had happened and what this was all about. After reviewing our record, she said that Sallie Mae actually did not try to contact us. Nowhere was it written that they tried to contact us to let us know that our account was in trouble, which is very strange since they would call at all hours of the day or night, seven days a week, if a payment was late only within a week. Very strange!Now, after reviewing their records again, they said that they did mail out notices that our loan was delinquent. I do not believe they sent them out; we never received them. The first we heard was in early 2013. They informed us of the loan status that we believed we no longer had due to the combined rate reduction. We talked on the phone about a forbearance that they would mail to us. We never received it.In the meantime, believing that it would come any day, we sent a payment in to show our good faith. We spoke with Tracy, Tara, and Roxanne to try to get them to purchase back the loan, which they must do if mistakes were made on their part. The first mistake they made was telling us that all loans were combined, which it is obvious now that they were not. They said that they did try to contact us through the mail. I do not believe them since we did not receive what they claimed they sent. We have received different stories and ""facts"" from everyone we spoke to there. I believe once they find the mistakes they made, they would go back and cover up their tracks.I firmly believe that this is a practice of Sallie Mae. They are using these unethical (if not illegal) practices to gain more money. As I said, we were, and still are, making payments on the combined loans. I have never defaulted on any loan in my entire history. They first give you so many different loans that it's hard to keep them straight, while hounding you to death on the phone; they then say they are combining all loans into one, but make a mistake and leave one out. Then they do not contact you until it is in default. They sell the account and never have to deal with you again. I feel they should be investigated for their shoddy and unethical practices.I am only asking for two very simple things to happen:1) PHEAA to return the loan to Sallie Mae so that we can continue to make payments, as we always had until ALL loans were combined (except this one); and2) Remove and restore my credit rating by removing all negative reports against me.I will never stop digging deeper and pulling more government agencies into this until it is resolved. On the combined rate reduction loan, which comes out of our bank account automatically in the sum of $376.11, they claim we are only paying $366.11. Who is getting the additional $10.00 per month that is coming out of our account each month? Are they also, in the coming months or years, say that this, too, is in default because we did not pay the correct amount, or is someone pocketing the other $10.00?This entire experience with Sallie Mae has been a nightmare, a living hell. We have nothing left to do. We have never defaulted on a loan; we feel that if we borrow something, we need to pay it back. There have been mistakes made here on Sallie Mae's part, and we would like it made right."

2013-06-15 16:14:24,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",E,1.0,"I had called back in January of 2013 to see how much I owed as a total so I can pay it off completely. The check was sent in February 2013. I had thought that it was taken care of until I received a letter regarding a loan that wasn't paid off. When I called to see what had happened, they told me I still owed money and I asked how that could be when a representative told me the amount I owed. There was no solid answer for the mix up. This representative told me that if I pay x amount before the month of June ended, then no more interest would be added to it. I kept an eye on my account and noticed the amount that I owed increasing. I called again to find out what happened. Again, I was told there was a mix up. This time, I was told interest is daily. At this time, I'm realizing they can't train their staff or their staff is told purposely to lie to the customer. At this time, I also checked how my first check was used. I saw that only 2/3 went to my principal while another third went to interest. When I reviewed this information, I went over my terms and it says that if my principal balances are paid off, then interest would stop occurring. This is the only reason I can think of why my full check didn't go to my principal balance - so they could keep collecting on the interest. I asked this question too and was not given an answer. I sent in another check to finish off the balance and called to ask them why it hasn't been processed. They told me there's no way to find out why and I reassured them that I sent it verified mail so I know they have it. I asked about the daily interest and they told me they would keep charging me until the check was processed. I don't know if this is legal. If I send a check and the facility gets it on Monday, but waits until Friday to process it, then I shouldn't be held responsible for the interest occurring from Tuesday to Friday, but this is what they told me would happen. If anyone decides to use this company, I strongly advise against it. I would suggest getting loans from a place that you have looked into and also a place where you can talk to someone face to face. I also suggest you bring someone with you that understands contracts. I was 19 when I signed on four loans and it was for school. I should have just gone through my bank, but I was fooled by the idea of not having to pay anything until I completed my courses and how low the monthly payments would be. After reading more into it, I found out my payments would jump way high if they weren't paid off in 3 years. I was not told this. Be very careful if you decide to do business with this company."

Certainly I wouldn't even tell anyone to get a loan with them even if it's a small amount because in the end, they charge you for things which they don't even know about that turn unexceptional for a Federal based bank to operate like this; I will never advise anyone to using Sallie Mae. It is sad that if you can't pay outright, you really should not be going to higher education because the government wants us to deal with a company like THIS and I'm not even behind or late on my payments. It's just these people who base things off from idk where with their interest rate higher than my mortgage rate. Lol, it's just a stupid place to go with for financial aid."

I was getting late fees for loans I never received, paperwork saying the payment was due. I called CS and was told the late fees are unable to be reversed PR removed. After three months of this, I consolidated what I could with the Dept. of Ed. and have been completely satisfied with DOE. This year, I have had to fight with them to stop sending me separate statements for each of two loans. I have fought with them via phone - called six times now. Also, the payment was due on the 26th each month. They wanted one payment on the third and one on the 22nd of each month. I've argued for three hours total about this issue as my budget is set up so they get one lump sum at the end of the month. I have had to bite the bullet and move my payment due date up 4 days. They lower my payment every three to six months as I start getting ahead of the interest. They want to keep you from paying anything on the principal.If I can say anything to future students its this: borrow from local banks or work with your schools financial aid team to get grants and scholarships. Do not use any assistance from Sallie Mae. Also ask your school's FA team if there is a local private lender that you can borrow through. I had one with my school and it was interest free; and I had it paid off in a year. Do not use Sallie Mae at all."

Oh, yes and just one more thing... that will cost you an extra US$15 to pay by credit card...

You want me to make two phone calls and pay an extra US$30 in fees so that I can pay my loan? Now, I am seeing red.When I asked to whom I could talk with about this terrible and unfair business practice, I was told the only way to make a complaint would be to compose a formal letter and mail it to the Sallie Mae address with Attn: Regional Manager in the address. I could not even get a name of a human with whom to correspond. The consequences are that I refuse to pay extra fees just for the privilege of paying back my student loans. I will also refuse to pay any and all interest added to the loan as consequence of my refusal to pay the extra. It is Sallie Mae's problem that their system is antiquated, not mine."

I contacted Sallie Mae on May 24, 2013 at 9:27 am and was informed that I was not withdrawn from auto debit.On May 28, 2013, I again contacted Sallie Mae again at 6:15 pm because my refund had still not been applied to my account. I was told it would be in my account on Monday, the 27th. I waited until Tuesday because Monday was Memorial Day. The person I spoke with informed me that the previous person I spoke with had lied to me and that it would take 7-10 business days for the refund to be placed into my account. I, of course, became furious and frustrated with the situation, and demanded action. The supervisor informed me that they would put a priority on my refund and I would have it in 24-48 hours. At this time, I also double checked to make sure I had been removed from the auto debit, which they confirmed. I also specifically asked if this was effective immediately and was informed that yes, it was.I checked my bank account the next day and found that I had been charged an overdraft fee yet again. That is $90 in overdraft fees! So, I once again contacted Sallie Mae on May 29, 2013 at 3:45 pm. I immediately asked to speak to a supervisor and demanded an explanation for the continued lies. She informed me that it should have been explained to me that my removal from auto debit wouldn't take effect until next month. Since I had them on the phone, I inquired about my refund and was told that it was approved and on the way.On May 31, 2013 at 6:34 pm I again called Sallie Mae; I had waited the 48 hours and still had not received my refund. The Supervisor I spoke with informed me that once posted, it would take 24 hours to get into my account - yet another lie. I argued with this woman and informed her that this was getting out of control. I keep being put off, and am sick of it.This company has lied to me numerous times. I find this unacceptable. I live paycheck to paycheck and cannot afford any one messing with my finances. I have been given excuses and apologies, but I require money to live on."
2013-06-01 14:33:06,"Glen Allen, VA",Rashida,1.0,"I have 1 private loan with Sallie Mae and 2 Stafford loans. In March 2006, I paid off my private loan in full while continuing to make regular payments on my Stafford loans. During the time period between April 2006 and 2012, Sallie Mae randomly intercepted 4 payments, totaling about $300, sent for my Stafford loan and applied them to the private loan which was already paid-in-full and not to mention it was sent to NCO Collections in 2004 before I even paid it off, so it should have no longer been in their system as an active loan. They took my $300 and kept it completely for themselves. I received no credit towards my current Stafford loans nor was my money returned to me. For 6 years I've been calling them demanding to speak to supervisors to only be told, ""Yes, I see where the payments have been incorrectly posted, but this will require research, so I must create a work ticket"".My Advice: To anyone even thinking about receiving a PRIVATE LOAN from Sallie Mae, BEWARE! DO NOT DO IT. They will steal from you and unlike most company's who rush to correct their wrongs made to customers, Sallie Mae is so immoral they don't give darn about a customer. We Come a dime a dozen to them and they couldn't care less if we're cheated out of our money!"
2013-05-31 20:41:48,"Gaithersburg, MD",Andre,1.0,"I cosigned a Sallie Mae loan for my daughter's junior year of college. She has three years' worth of loans with Sallie Mae, and she has to pay each one independently. They refuse to consolidate them because the loans are private and not federal. After my daughter graduated, she began working but she doesn't make that much and her total monthly payments to Sallie Mae are over $800. She eventually fell behind on the loan that I co-signed, and it's now about six months behind. I spoke with them and I've been making almost double payments for the last two months, but they still call repeatedly. I certainly understand debt collection, but they go overboard with being rude, attempted intimidation, and repeated calls. I would love to see school counselors and financial aid offices STOP referring kids to Sallie Mae for loans. ALL other alternatives should be exhausted before using Sallie Mae. By using Sallie Mae, kids are facing years of abuse from this company. It's a very taxing and frustrating experience for a young person trying to start their lives after college."
2013-05-28 15:33:03,"The Hood, NJ",B,1.0,"There seems to be no rhyme or reason to the actions of Sallie Mae. I have 2 small loans through them to cover some education costs, but I feel like they are trying to set me up for failure to pay these back! First, they attack my co-signer when I pay on time. I submit online payments about a week in advance, and there was one time, for some reason, no one knows why, it did not reach them in time. If you are late, forget about it. It will take you at least a year to climb out from under their **. They claimed I was late every month since the one slip up. Finally, a day came when I got a call from the people they passed the loan on to. This young woman on the other end sounded about my age at the time (23) and was very nasty with me. She claimed I had been late for months. I found her funny trying to be intimidating so about 15 minutes into the call I started having fun with her. Basically, I finally got out of her that since I was late, there was a past due fee I had to pay that I was constantly behind on!Finally, after getting them off my co-signer and my back, one day out of the blue, I get an email notification that my loan due date had been pushed back. I had no issues for about a year and a half with them so I figured this was a good sign. So I show up as usual, a week in advance of my brand new due date, only to find that it only applied to one of the loans! I am past due on the other so I sent extra money. We will see if they let the dogs loose again. My advice, if you are seeking a job in Medicine, Law, or other Sciences, please, by all means, go to school! Anything else, learn WordPress and coding and sit behind a PC and learn how to run freelance or work for yourself because there are no other jobs or avenues that will keep you sane. What a waste of time my higher education has been!!!"

I have never applied for these loans but they claim I did. The college is the one who electronically signed for these loans and received the money in full. I never saw any promissory note (and they cannot provide one with my signature on it) or any promissory note that includes the percentage rate. I requested these documents from the college who claim they don't keep any of those types of documents, and I have contacted Sallie Mae several times (phone and mail) without providing me the requested documents. I have never signed for these loans nor can Sallie Mae provide proof because it doesn't exist. The loan is now up to $13k and I don't know what to do about this."

I finished schooling at 24 and my loan was up to $100k. It is now at $140k even though I have paid nearly $10k on this loan. There is no doubt I will be paying for the rest of my life and my loan will only continue to grow... It doesn't seem to add up to anything but more money for Albert L. Lord, CEO, at $53.012 million for 5 years and less money for my child and me. I will never advise anyone to using Sallie Mae.

2013-04-23 15:14:42,"Starkville, MS",Jen ,1.0,"I just posted a very professional post about a negative experience I continue to have with Sallie Mae over the past 10 years regarding misapplied payments which erroneous late fees on my account, and poor current customer service with a new automated system that prevents access to a representative. I also posted ways to circumvent the automated system to actually get a human being. My post was removed immediately so, Sallie Mae, not only is your customer service deplorable, you only post good things about yourself! Pat yourself on the back.Here is some additional information - since I graduated - I have paid well over 35G in loans back to Sallie Mae. Throughout the process, I would have to phone in monthly as they would misapply payments to the different loan bulks, which would then incur late fees. I would have to call monthly go through the process of getting a senior person on the phone and would have the payments applied correctly. Following that, they would refund the late fees. I recently finished up a residency and was in deferment. I did not register in the spring to take a semester off from the graduate program. My loans came out of deferment and although I am registering for summer and fall, I've decided to once again begin to pay them down. 1 payment in and Sallie Mae was up to their old tricks! I paid $200 over the due amount (around $800) and they misapplied to a bulk of loans that isn't due till June or July. The account incurred 50 dollars in late fees due to their mistake. I tried to reach them via phone but their automated system now makes it impossible to reach a human being (typically a senior rep) that can deal with these issues. I had to email them and demand that someone call me back to correct the issue. A senior rep called me back in 48 hours (on a Saturday) which is the only nice thing I can say - and fixed the issue. My $50 will be refunded (which is typical if you catch this mistake). However, the senior rep who handled the issue transferred me to a closed department for my refund. So that will have to wait until Monday.There are only 2 ways you can reach a person at Sallie Mae now. One is to email and demand an urgent call back. Two is to have your banking institution contact them directly via a special phone number that only they have. Complain to your congressman if you are having similar issues.Had I known what I know today, I would have never financed my education through Sallie Mae! I have complained to the Better Business Bureau twice in the past 10 years and received over a hundred dollars in a recent class action lawsuit."

He has discussed this on the phone with them on several occasions and has asked them to lower it to something manageable. They will not lower it to something he can afford. They will allow him to defer the loan for $150 for 3 months, but the $150 does not go towards paying off his loan. He finally decided to stop paying and stop deferring in an attempt to make them realize that they must lower his payment. They call him multiple times a day, this includes Saturdays and Sunday. Additionally they call his parents, who have nothing to do with his school loan, multiple times a day. Yesterday, they called me for the first time ever saying that he ""used me as a reference"", which is a lie. They used this new lie on his parents as well. Around Christmas time, we would get red card envelopes in the mail that appeared to be holiday cards from friends/family, but once opened, we saw they were from Sallie Mae. We even got an envelope from UPS one day from Sallie Mae. They are great at harassing us, but no matter how much they harass us, it is impossible for us to make the payment they're asking us for ($500+ a month). We have told them we could squeeze $300, but they will not lower to that amount and will not accept ""partial payments""."

She did as they asked and it took over a month for them to find her payment. Instead of just applying it to her account, they sent it back to her. When I called to make a payment over the phone to clear this whole thing up, again, they would not waive the $14.99 over-the-phone payment fee. I spoke to a very nasty ""supervisor"" who spoke over me condescendingly, finally stating (after 2 months) that my daughter mailed it to the wrong department. The whole thing took over 2 months to clear up. I am very disappointed in Sallie Mae and am looking for another financial institution to buy her loans.

I thought I was doing myself a favor by subsidizing my student loans and making Sallie Mae my only lender. Unfortunately, I found out that this is one of the worst loan companies ever, after the fact. I deferred my loans for 1 month and they increased my monthly payments for the life of my loans by $40. This is absolutely absurd. They might as well venture into the payday loan business. They seem to fair quite well at ripping everyday people off."
2013-03-22 21:42:55,"Orlando, FL",Rojet,1.0,"I called Sallie Mae and spoke with Kaitlin at ext. **. She agreed that a certain amount would be taken out of my account on a certain date every month for certain private loans. She agreed to it and everything, and I'm thinking everything is fine until I looked at my bank account activity and realized that I was charged 5 days before I was supposed to be. I was at risk of having overdrafts because of her, and if she can't pay attention and do what she leads customers to believe she is doing for us, she shouldn't be doing the job. They should employ someone that would actually do the job right. College graduates like myself have a hard time finding jobs but screw-ups and people that don't care about the quality of their work can get a job before those of us that would do the job accordingly? This doesn't include all grads but you get my point.Anyway, I called back and another worker told me that only one of the loans was paid on, so not only did she charge me earlier than requested, she didn't even allocate accordingly even though she agreed that. I spoke with a supervisor to put in a complaint, not for the sake getting Kaitlin fired, but to tell her to wake the hell up. Management will do what they will with her, especially if they are actually trying to weed out bad employees. I had to call back today because (wait for it...) I was charged on the requested date as well, and it really pisses me off. I have bills pending payment soon and if those aren't paid, that's a cause and effect that I don't wish to deal with, but I would expect and demand that Sallie Mae pay for it because it was no fault of my own. They refunded it but said it will take 24 to 48 hours.This isn't the first problem I've had with them in regards to these loans. I was told that they could be grouped together into one payment prior to a separate payment at a certain amount being paid like now. I was told they would be grouped together for one payment amount, got several confirmations and after being notified that payment was delinquent for one of the loans, I found out that they weren't and could not be grouped together regardless of the confirmations I was given over the course of several days. I had to go through Sallie Mae's customer advocate because they didn't want to work with me and honor what they led me to believe. The supervisor (Lucius) wanted me to forget about it as if I'd just accept that crap. So the customer advocate worked on the case basically so that they could get a grip and honor the lie I was told. And during that time, Sallie Mae sent the unpaid loan to a collection agency (National Enterprise Systems that had an extremely aggressive worker by the name of Raymond ** who tried to make it seem like I refused to pay regardless of the pending case and actually hung up on me, but no one answered when I called back to make a complaint about his rudeness). That amount was recovered from collections by the advocate, and now I am here trying to move forward like I was prior to this **, and it's one problem after another based on Sallie Mae hiring some of the dumbest people. How can someone make good on payments, or at least try regardless of situations if we are being met with problems from the lender? It's a stupid situation that I have no time for. I'm trying to make money to keep our heads above water so that we don't end up on the damn street not wasting time because of bad customer service."

The first person you speak with is always nice and then you are transferred once you give your information. Not all the time, but most of the time, the person you speak with next is already argumentative and pissed off because the calls they get are people who are pissed because Sallie Mae screwed something up. They are the worst company I have ever dealt with. There are so many other companies to use. Please don't do what I did and use Sallie Mae. Every time you need to speak with someone, you will be let down. I talked to Latricia in the ghetto (I know this because she said, ""I'm in the ghetto dawg""). I was then transferred to someone name Alger or Aljeer (English is definitely not his first or second language). I have been told lies when people don't know what the answer is; they given the wrong pay date, the wrong forbearance end date, invalid credit card entry (put someone elses name with my credit card info, how that happens only god knows), a voided credit card entry that made my payment late, because no one put a name on the card I used after I changed it so I had to pay late fees (i.e. they just ran the card without anyones name on it after I told them whoevers name is on the card is not mine and gave them my name), and not to mention sitting on hold for hours out of a day to try to find someone that has more brains than my dog. I have had the phone hung up on me by some lady who would not give me her name or code. I have never been put on hold so many times in my life with a company. For a while I thought they may just not write anything down and just argue with you for ten minutes and act like they are doing things to your account, but I figured it out. I think they write things down with crayons that is why they can never keep track of anything. I am an attorney myself so I do not need anyone to contact me, but I will help anyway; I can if you send me an email. Also, this isn't a big deal, but every time I call, they have the wrong address for me listed so I don't get anything in the mail. I have given them my address twice and no one will change it. I tried to get email notices since they can't figure out how to write my address so they can read it (it is hard sometimes with crayons), but I have never received one email."

And inevitably, I have called the wrong number, because they don't post the number I need on their contact information.

So you can imagine what having a sum like that stolen from your account 7 weeks before Christmas is like. Apparently, there's a student out there with the same last name as ours and they paid her loan with our money! It has become a part-time job trying to get this money back. I call every week, lately every day, and each time I call, I have to start from square one as no one there has any idea what's going on. This has taken 4 months already with no end in sight. Then I get put on hold and when someone picks up 20 minutes later, they have no idea why I'm holding and I have to start all over again! I don't know how many hours I've spent on the phone with them but every time I call, it's at least 45-90 minutes. Then I spent money faxing proof of bank transactions, certified mail. I even missed calls for overtime for my job, because I didn't want to lose my place in the phone queue so that's more money out of my pocket. You dial one number and they say, ""No, try this other number,"" and when you get through, they tell you that you must call the first number back!I've never seen such incompetence in my life! This is how we were rewarded for being a customer of Sallie Mae and paying off our loans on time in good order. They steal money from our bank account and it's on me to prove everything.

This harassment has been going on for over a year and just doesn't stop. I receive mail of late payments and phone calls often. I am on a 3-hour time zone difference of where I receive these phone calls and they are always early Saturday and Sunday mornings. I question why they do not contact her first and why they seem to never have payments updated. It is the same story every time. Once they look, they see they have received payment and rudely act as if they are doing nothing wrong without apology.I became so frustrated at getting weekly early phone calls this past week that I asked to speak to a manager to try and resolve this issue. Once I got to talk to a manager, she was just as incoherent as everyone else I speak to. She was very rude and gave no effort to make things any better. She also went through the same wrong payment issue as everyone else. Just pathetic! I guess this saga is never going to end and I just wanted to give my two cents on how horrible this corporation is, as everyone else I have read about.

Instead, they keep telling the loan is paid off and they would not accept the money; however, the State of Kansas did in fact garnish my check and sent the money to West Asset Management, because they never issued a withholding cancellation notice until I make over 5 phone calls to Sallie Mae, US Funds and West Asset Management because no one wanted to help, instead passing me off to someone else.

That was not a problem until the smaller of my loans neared full repayment. I pay by mail using SMs preprinted payment coupons. Shortly after the coupons indicated that it had been paid off (by this I mean the payment amount went down), I received a letter saying I was overdue. I went online and checked. Apparently, these math wizards (I mean that is their only real duty, doing the math correctly) left a partial payment unaccounted for on my coupons. So I called them and explained what the problem was. I offered to add the difference to my next payment, but I was not going to pay the penalties, etc., incurred by their mistake. ""Spencer"" put me on hold for over 20 minutes before returning to say that the penalties would be removed. I double-checked with him as to the amount still owed, as well as how much my existing loan payment was, and how much those two amounts would total. Next payment was made with these adjustments. A month later, another overdue notice. After checking online again, there was still fifteen cents left on the loan - talk about nickel and diming. Also, it seems that instead of clearing the penalties, SM shifted the amount to my other loan payment, raising the amount due almost five dollars over what my coupons indicate, setting me up for more BS. I'm still in communication about this, so I can't say how this will end. But I'm pretty sure it won't be to my liking.But enough complaining. What I really want is some direction toward someone who can help people like us take SM to task. We've just let all these greedy/incompetent money-grubbers get away with almost bankrupting our country. Isn't there anything we can do to defend ourselves against this sort of willful disrespect?"

The daily and 7 times a day calls from a collection company hired by Sallie Mae from Newark were more than I could handle. Not only did they treat me like I was a bad customer (not knowing my circumstances), but they were very rude. On January 31st, I was able to make a payment over the phone and I did inform them that I only get paid once a month and that if I came up with some cash before the end of the month, I will call them to process a payment. I made another payment on 02/11/13. Yesterday (02/14/13), I got a call from Sallie Mae requesting another payment. I advised them again that I just recently made a payment and my next payment was going to be processed at the end of the month. They offered to help me bring down my past due if I postdate two payments. I told them that I make payments in different ways, meaning with different credit cards. Postdating a payment was not a good option for me and also I've had very bad luck doing that in which by mistake, the incorrect payment amount has been taken out from my accounts leaving me with hardly anything to go by the rest of the month. The man who spoke with me started saying that I just didn't want to pay and that they were going to keep calling me every day until I get the account cleared. He even assumed that this loan was a student loan saying that I already graduated and I was working, so it was my responsibility as a student to pay them back. Little did he know that this loan was to cover tutoring classes for my child that has a learning disability. Today, I got another call to request another payment. I advised the man that I spoke with someone yesterday and the same attitude of rudeness. I told this man that I could not come up with any more money until the end of the month, and I advised him of the two recent payments I had made. He didn't even care and offered again postdating of a payment. I told him that was not an option and he told me that they were going to keep calling me every day and ended up hanging up on me. What kind of customer service do they have in their company? Not every person who gets behind in their monthly payments do it just for the pleasure of it. My vehicle got repossessed; my home is in foreclosure and my husband lost his job a few months ago. I'm trying to survive and still I'm sending payments. These are very unprofessional ways and so-called options of helping a customer."

Somehow the monies get posted to the same account and this throws the second account into a delinquent status. So, on the 16th of the month, the calls start from sun up to sundown. It has gotten to the point we try to just ignore the calls but finally got so pissed off at the continued calls we answer and go through the same spiel, ""We are not delinquent. Look at both accounts. Do you see two payments posted to that account?"" The caller said, ""Yes."" ""Well, y'all have done it again, posted the monies to the same account."" I keep asking, ""What else can we do besides paying what we are supposed to do? Can we come to your location and post the flipping payment ourselves?"" This is nothing but harassment and if anyone has a name and number that I can call and report this to, please let me know. Each time, we are told, ""Oh, we are sorry, we will fix it,"" and the next day they are calling again. And they wonder why people are going off in America! This is a fine example!"

I started school and thought my ex-wife was paying the bill because I had no correspondence telling me otherwise. When I graduated, Sallie Mae sent me a bill saying that I had to start paying my student loan back since I graduated. My first thought was that my employer paid for my schooling. Are they crazy? But no, the student loan went from $15,000.00 to $21,576.00 in three years, and Sallie Mae took my ex-wifes name and step-daughter off the loan. I was on the hook for the balance. What a bummer.

I was in contact with them for weeks trying to find the payment. Every confirmation number I got from the bank wasn't enough. They were always missing something. I complained to the BBB and am now in contact with someone else. She helped track the payment to Direct Loans which is the same everything except one digit in the zip code. So, after finally tracking it to the company, they pretty much refused to even try to track it. I had to call Direct Loans and get a transaction number. The lady I am stuck dealing with says they can't locate it and again they need something. Direct Loans sent them the check on 1/22. They gave the transaction number and I gave it to Sallie Mae and they refuse to even attempt to do anything to resolve this matter. The lady I am dealing with tries to also play stupid and asks me questions when I gave her the information a week ago with the work I had to do.

I call, write, and email; and I get no response whatsoever. I do receive past due notices and statements that tell me I am delinquent which is also incorrect. When you apply for a change in payment plan, you are supposed to be put in administrative forbearance. Their website even says that, but not me. I'm delinquent for some reason. I assume they will send their information to the credit reporting agencies as well, and I can do nothing to stop this! I am just another victim of Sallie Mae. I understand they have a very poor rating and I know why. So my credit will be ruined, and I can do nothing? How is this company allowed to do this to people?

They said I can call to make card payments. I have been on the phone for half an hour already (and still counting) without talking to a single representative. This is ridiculous. It's the same story every time I call. There's got to be another company my student loans can go through! They probably do it on purpose so I will give up and give them bank account info.

2013-01-28 15:58:08,"Rocky Point, NC",Maria,1.0,"I took a signature loan out back in 2005. Not to be repaid until I finished college. My mother, who is now 83 and has dementia, was my co-signer. The loan I took out was $8,500.00. I have been paying on it for 3 1/2 years and since they have been changing the interest rate on a daily basis, even after paying on it, I now have an outstanding balance of over $17,000.00. Sallie Mae constantly calls my cell phone even in the middle of the night and on Saturdays and Sundays. They claim that they can do it. They have been harassing my ill mother with phone calls and letters telling her that they are going to take her Social Security and any tax returns she gets. What I don't understand, even after sending a cease and desist letter from harassing me and my mother, is they continue to do it. I am currently not working, suffering from an enlarged heart, diabetes and other medical issues. I also am the only caretaker for my terminally ill husband. I have a son who wants to go to college, but after witnessing everything that my mother and I go through, he has changed his mind. I have a master's degree in Criminal Justice, but have been unable to use it or even find a job. I make my payments; most of the time they are on time, sometimes they are late since I live on my husband's social security. We can barely survive on that with bills and medications. I would like some assistance with the harassing phone calls and letters. They told me that they would no longer harass my mother, yet they continue to do it. My family is getting seriously pissed off at me because I am doing my best, but they are still harassing my mother and me. Is there anything at all you can do to stop this harassment? I think it is totally sick that they have turned an $8,500.00 loan into me owing over $17,000.00, because they change the interest rate everyday. It is sick and I really don't know how they expect me to pay it off when making the payments I am making don't change the balance at all."

I called and they said the computer system distributed it to the wrong loans. Now it shows that I'm late on payments? That's not my fault; they never called me back after I had asked for a callback to see if it was redistributed. But now I'm getting calls and my co-borrower is getting calls saying we owe? My credit is messed up now. It was awesome before and now every time I call Sallie Mae, they keep messing up my loan. No one knows what they are talking about. No one makes correct notes of what I ever say and my loan is out of hand since years ago. Now it's some crazy amount like a hundred thousand and no one has ever helped me. When I was laid off and I had trouble paying my loans a few years ago, they said all deferment was not available anymore. I'm pretty much broke each month because of mishandling of all my and my co-borrowers loans and credit is destroyed. They keep debiting my account and taking my money. They say if I don't pay that amount, they will take taxes at tax time etc. so I keep paying in fear of taking what I'm relying on for my children. I need help to lower monthly payments and find out what they have done to my loans. I can't go into an office and everyone on the phone never helps me understand and has any right answers.

Yet, they continue calling and asking me to fax them proof. I have had my department chairperson write three letters of proof, which they ignored.

Payments rarely distributed to the correct account (requiring inordinate amounts of time speaking with customer service reps to correct mistakes, which costs me money in interest rates). Faulty communication in regards to deferments and other changes in status. Their systems do not allow proper access from a Mac, i.e., my account information will show up blank (and come on, what state-of-the-art company does not take Apple products into consideration?). Password requests/resets take hours to complete (that is, the email will not show up until at least an hour after requesting). I have to spend too much of my own free time dealing with their incompetence and mistakes, yet I have no choice in the matter, being that this is who my federal loans are now handled by. Back when my loans were handled by the Department of Educations Direct Loan service department, I did not deal with these headaches and blatant incompetence. I'm currently looking to see if I can transfer these loans to another company. It's bad enough dealing with the stress of paying back school loans and the compiling interest rates. Sallie Mae only adds to the stress, and if I could, I would avoid them like the plague."

I have set up an automatic payment schedule with my bank, making sure that it was going to the correct payment address. About 4 months ago, we started receiving late notices on this automatic payment. We then would receive a deposit back in our account from Sallie Mae ... no explanation! We called to see what the situation was and we would talk to someone. They put us on hold and, 10 minutes later, we were disconnected. This happened 3 times. I asked for an explanation through the website and didn't receive an answer. In December, we received a letter claiming we were 120 days past due when we were sending out the payment automatically. After receiving another ""hate later"" from accounting, we had a lengthy discussion which included a conference call with our bank to verify what was going on. We were promised we would hear what the remedy was, but we kept receiving daily robo calls to pay up. Today, we talked with customer service once again and tried to reach the person from the week before; she had given us her employee number. Instead, we were blocked off and had to explain the whole thing again. Considering we verified that Sallie Mae was depositing money back into our account each month, we okayed the full payment, but have no idea if our automatic payment will make it to them in the months to come. If these ""delinquent"" payments show up on our credit report, or if we have extra charges, I will be contacting an attorney."

But I would be able to make a $25 or $50 payment. After that, he went off the deep end.

After all this time, Sallie Mae decides to send her a letter last week stating that she is in default of her loan. They have told her that she will need to pay $780 monthly. My sister has spoken to a representative and 2 supervisors that are saying that there is nothing they can do and that she has to pay that amount or be sent to collections. As far as I know (and I have been in college myself), you don't have to make payments or at least payments in that amount if you are still a student. I'm sure a huge chunk of the loan is interest! I think this is an outrageous practice to bully students into paying such huge sums of money, especially in this economy! How is my sister supposed to live! She has rent, car, &amp; utilities to pay just like most people. And now Sallie Mae wants to threaten her good credit! Stay away from Sallie Mae loans!"

Meanwhile, my credit is horrible. I paid on my loans for years prior to entering the military and continue to pay a portion of the total amount due. It's amazing how many people I have spoken to at Sallie Mae that all give me different advice with absolutely no follow through, and you can never speak to the same person twice even with their extension. I have never been so frustrated with a company that hires ill trained and rude employees. I would like to find a person that knows what they are talking about."
2013-01-01 16:09:49,"Smyrna, TN",Betty,1.0,"I had a Parent Plus Loan through Sallie Mae for my sons college education. Originally, I had signed with another bank and somehow wound up with them without my knowledge. They started sending me emails saying to log on to my Sallie Mae account to see my loan details and make a payment. There was nothing via mail telling me I even had an account with them. After months of ignoring the emails as a scam, I got a delinquency notice in the mail. At that point I was quite a few months behind on the student loan that payments were not to start on until my son was out of college. Not the case, but I wouldn't know as they sent me nothing even stating I had the loan with them. When I started making payments, they often didn't credit that payment and made online for well over a week after the payment was made. So even if you made it several days prior to the due date, it was late. Often the money was taken out of the bank account on time, but the payment was still deemed late and they would apply a $59 late fee. They also do love to call you on the hour every day - your payment is deemed late with strong arm threats. In October of this year, I consolidated my Sallie Mae loans (somehow wound up with two separate loans on the one education) with the U.S. Department of Education. Everything was paid off at almost twice the original loan value plus all late fees were consolidated into the new loan. The other day I get an email to loan into my Sallie Mae account because I have a delinquency - two months after the loans were paid off! The claim was I owed another $55.66 on the second paid-off loan that in the transition history shows everything was paid. When I called, I got a guy from a call center in India who implied the entire second loan wasn't paid. After arguing with him for almost an hour, he agreed it was actually paid but I owed this $55.66 but reason why. Just if I paid it the loan would be paid off. When I explained there was no explanation online and no way to pay it, he did his magic and I was able to pay $55.56 online. As it wouldn't let me pay the $55.66 it said I still owed claiming I would be paying more than is due. I am sure in a couple of months I will again owe for this 10 cents with another late fee added. Is there anyone out there who defends people from these thieving bastards?!"

I know one time her mother contacted Sallie Mae and made arrangements for Sallie Mae to call them to deal with the payments and Sallie Mae did not call them. Meanwhile, I am getting calls from them. What happened to customer service? Why would they call me and demand payment when the borrower has contacted them and is trying to make arrangements/payment? Why does Sallie Mae refuse to call and contact the borrower first before threatening the co-signer? Why can't their customer reps read the notes on the accounts and see that arrangements are being made? If they need to follow up on those, why don't they take a moment and call the borrower to clear up the matter? Why are the representatives so poorly trained?"

When I made a payment online and called in to see if it was received, they said it wasn't. I did another payment and both payments hit at the same time. I asked for my money back which they said they could refund, but they never did. They applied it to another loan as a double payment and said I was good until November. Now, I am getting 47-day notice that the payment is late when you can see online that the double payment was made. When I called in, they told me about the May payment that magically got lost or appeared. The account I am finding out should have been put in forbearance, but the payment never took and they didn't tell me. Now, I am out two months worth of payments with another one on the way. Did I mention when I told them about the problems I have been having, they hung up on me? The reason, they are in collections, they don't have to be good at customer relations.

Imagine my surprise when on Thursday, I got an overdraft fee from my bank. They had taken both payments out of my automatic debit account. When I called to have them look at the account I made the second payment out of, they said they had no way of doing that. They then said that in the future, I need to make sure I make the payment out of the right account! How would they know they have no record of it!? (Unfortunately, neither do I since I did not save the screen.) My online payment never gives any record of where the payment is taken out of. She then unenrolled me from automatic debit saying that was my problem. Although how that had anything to do with it, I am unsure.

I received a letter dated October 31st, stating it was denied as it was not time for the 90-day review. So again I am submitting it for review as my first letter indicated I should do. I did fax it several times in October and even faxed the two letters I received for October 7th (stating it was 90 days till current application would expire) and October 31st (stating it was denied as I had not gotten my letter, that my application was about to expire 90 days which of course I had gotten it earlier in the month) around November 8th. I did attach the first page of both letters, along with application so they can see the confusion. I asked that someone could either call, email me or US mail me a response ASAP. I have already dealt with another big company with the BBB and got them to fix things, so I am not one that will back down from easily. I also noted some of the other complaints for other Sallie Mae customers and want to let them know never to sign up for auto-payments from any of the edu companies. Why? Because they can change things without notifying you and increase your payment. Even if it takes half your paycheck, they don't care.

I contacted Sallie Mae within those three weeks 5 times (3 times with their representatives, and the final two times with two managers). The first two times, each representative told me that it will be sent within 24-48 hours through email. Nothing came. I called again and the third rep said it cannot be done through email, and my request will be expedited within 7-10 business days through regular mail. I waited, and nothing came. Then as the deadline approached, I was on the phone with one manager. He apologized since the request was not even processed and that he will send the request again to have it emailed to me within 48 hours, so I can have my packet post marked on the deadline date. He told me they don't have a phone number to contact the department that was supposed to be in charge. Everything must be requested through email. Can you believe that a big company like this would have no phone number for their managers to contact in case of an emergency? Still, nothing was sent to me on the deadline date. I called again, and another manager apologized and said she cannot do anything but to email the archiving department requesting it to email me the form again within 48 hours. By now, my CPA had to have the packet postmarked and sent without my 1098-E form to the IRS. I waited 3 weeks with 5 follow ups for a document and they still didn't send it to me.

2012-11-23 01:39:29,"Toledo, OH",B,1.0,"I originally signed a college loan with another company that went out of business and was sold to Sallie Mae. The company is one of the worst run companies I have ever seen. I personally know I have not found a company to buy out their loan. If anyone ever finds one, please let me know. Most companies will tell you Sallie Mae does intentionally not release your loans to other companies. I have even been told that if the company has paperwork to release the loan and buy the loan from Sallie Mae, they still do not release the loan.Also, calling them for any reason only brings nightmares. I found in the beginning even if I called to ask a basic question, my account there would have some sort error on the next payment somehow. I know of two other people who had similar experiences with this company. So do yourself a favor, when you talk to someone, write the time, date, their name and reason for your call (store it until whatever problem is completely resolved &amp; done). You can ask for their last name or work ID number. I was told they should technically be able to give both. Also, I had to mail my letters or checks to them - anything important you should send by certified mail with delivery confirmation. This stopped a lot of my headaches for a long while. And someone wrote about not paying them and letting it just go and eventually they settled; I have heard from two sources they did that and it worked.They do not care if you are unemployed, injured, or any other reason you may have no money. I just asked to lower my payment by 60-80 bucks, since I cannot afford the new payment of $300 a month in addition to my other college loans. What they forget to mention when you sign up for a lowered payment due to circumstances, it is for a limited time which you can never use again. Also, you payment will drastically increase. No one from the company ever mentioned this at the time of accepting an economic hardship. They will only offer to charge you to put your account into forbearance. They also somehow mess up payments and claim you never paid when they cashed the checks. The best part is, when you have not missed a payment and you can see every check was cashed, recite back check numbers and dates and time they cleared. You have to be persistent and keep calling. It only took me about 6-8 months to learn. You eventually find someone who knows what they are talking about.Overall, they are the worst company I have ever worked with. I would never recommend them. I also highly advise others to warn high school grads to pay attention to who they sign their loans with and if it is Sallie Mae, request another loan company. I have started to be much more careful when I sign my loans for my masters program. I just wish someone would find a way to sue this company and take them out."
2012-11-20 22:57:09,"San Bernardino, CA",Lauren,1.0,"Sallie Mae is not taking my payments on purpose in order to gain interest on my account. I have tried to pay them by mailing a money order along with the paper ticket that they send in the mail. They claimed that the money orders must have gotten lost in the mail so I had to cancel them and they charged me a late fee. I then tried to pay them online through a bank account and they posted the payment. A week later, I checked my account online just to check it and they had taken the payment down. I called them to ask why they did this and they said the bank account didn't exist (and they didn't call me or send an email; they said they sent a notice in the mail!). So basically, they were going to let the account go over 30 days past due before trying to contact me. If I hadn't thought to check my account online, it would have been 30 days late. Now I'm going to try to set up payments out of my paycheck and let's see what excuse they come up with next."
2012-11-16 22:49:30,"Bellevue, WA",Carol,1.0,"I co-signed for my granddaughter's loan with Sallie Mae. Just the name made me suspicious and I should have known better! They can't find payments that were made (and fortunately so far, checks have not been cashed). And when I finally decided to pay the loan off in full, it took several phone calls over 2 days before I finally settled on an amount (that they could not itemize) and paid them off. They promised I would get email confirmation, but so far nothing. Each call, sometimes even with the same person, I would be given a different payoff amount ranging over a $600 difference. This company is the worst of the worst!"
2012-11-16 15:52:07,"Mechanicsville, VA",DeeAnn,1.0,"I cosigned a student loan for my daughter. The loan application and approval process went quickly. Getting the money properly disbursed was challenging. When I called Sallie Mae to ask why funds were not disbursed, I was given a new scheduled disbursement date. That date came and went, and I called again. I was told same thing, new disbursement date. When I said the answer was not adequate since that is a repeat scenario, the rep checked and said there was an issue with an address that was now rectified, and a new date was set. That date came and went. I called again and was told there was a hold, and that it was the school's fault. I called the school who said there was no issue on their end. The financial aid office called Sallie Mae on my behalf and was able to have them clear the ""hold"", and the money was finally disbursed.We chose the option to pay interest now. I set up the payment from my online banking 2 weeks ahead of the due date to be sure there would be no problems. The payment cleared. A week later, I checked Sallie Mae, and the payment was not applied to the account. So, I called. I offered the transaction number, but they require a paper copy of the payment. Really? I've had private companies who can track a payment from the date and transaction number, but Sallie Mae cannot. To avoid a late payment, I used their online payment option and am waiting to find out where my other money landed. To add to the frustration of the above, Sallie Mae, as others have noted, is totally outsourced. While the reps are polite, they read from scripts and only from scripts."

My husband withdrew from school to change programs, and that's where the problems began. The requests and calls for payment started immediately, and before I knew it we were 3 months in arrears according to Sallie Mae, although only two months had passed. Clearly, the amount requested was being inflated. There was several hundred dollars in late fees being requested. I called several times to try to straighten things out. I was given different information every time. I submitted the requested paperwork to put the loans into a forbearance. And when I called to follow up, I was told I was missing pay stubs, signatures, it wasn't legible, etc. I am willing to make reasonable monthly payments and submit required documentation, if I can receive decent customer service and consistent information. It is ridiculous that I am forced to continue to deal with this company."

I contacted Sallie Mae in September immediately upon finishing school to set up a graduated payment schedule. The schedule was set to begin on 9/17/2012. I sent the first and second payment of $92.15. I then received this month a late notice of 25 days with a past due balance of $171 and several late fees. Sallie Mae is not accepting responsibility and the employees are not competent at all. Their entire department is outsourced. All the employees do is respond with exactly what I said back to them. No willingness to help. The response I got was, ""We can put your loans into forbearance."" How does that resolve the issue?"

At first, I answered and explained that he was only a few days, not even a payment late. They strong arm you and threaten you as the co-signer to make an immediate payment.

However, one year after I was in, they removed everything, stating that I needed new orders. Since when does an officer get a 1 year commitment to the military?! Now I am struggling to make payments while they refuse to honor my deferment again. I have the same orders since I didn't PCS or anything. What more do they want? It's federal law; there are no gray areas. I'm so ticked off, not to mention the complete lack of leeway for making payments affordable. Thank God I joined the military."
2012-10-23 01:22:52,"Frisco, TX",Michelle,1.0,"I applied for a loan for $5,000 with Sallie Mae and was refused. I'm 45 years of age, and I am in my last semester of nursing school and I have a 3.4 GPA and I am on the Dean's List. I need extra funds to get through the next few months for graduation and studying for my boards. I have very good credit, have never been late with my payments to them or to my other credit cards. I have two loans totaling $7500 with Sallie Mae. Sallie Mae's reason for refusing me, I was late with my mortgage payment a few times this past year. My husband receives his paychecks every other week and is responsible for the bills. Depending on how the bills fall due is when the mortgage can be paid. This is the only payment we are ever late with and never later than 29 days. I paid cash for my first two years of school. Then when I entered nursing school, I began taking out loans. I cannot believe that at this time in my college career, Sallie Mae is refusing to help me finish and graduate. This is probably one of the reasons Sallie Mae has so many people in default. They do not help you when you need it. Obviously, students call them for loans because they are having a hard time paying bills and getting through school. Sallie Mae has a duty to the students who work hard and want to contribute to the economy and repay their loans in a timely manner. Sallie Mae is the only option for students after federal loans, which leaves students at an unfair disadvantage."

He did file the papers through the military department, but as usual, Sallie Mae didn't care. They were going to get their money one way or the other. The Army sent them the proper papers. Needless to say, he was deployed to Iraq and you guessed it, they started calling us again! And they did not care he was Iraq. ""He is married. He is stationed in Fort Hood Texas. He is now in Iraq, and I have copies of the papers that were sent to Sallie Mae!"" ""Sir, we still need payment."" Are you kidding me!Eventually, we began getting calls from two separate collection agencies! The Army paid off the entire loan, and both our son and we received a payoff letter stating ""Paid in full"" ($41K!). You think it's over? Not by a long shot. We are now getting calls from another agency telling us that Sallie Mae claims we still owe another $530! Now it's on! It's time to have the military JAG office go after them."

They told me that since they haven't received payment from my daughter, that I have to pay. I told them I didn't have the money, that I haven't been able to find work and that my husband lost his job 5 months ago. On top of that, I have illnesses and am about to receive SSI so I can't pay.

On the form there was allowance to request on what date I wanted to start repayment of the loan, and I applied a date, a year from when I received the paperwork from him.

I did not send out my request for Hardship loan until the 7th of September 2012, because of not having any stamps. I sent it out on the 8th when I shopped. Im on a strict budget and must take a cab; I do not have a car. I recently received a letter from them stating that the date I wrote to repay was too far into the future.

Here is the part that blew me: ""We can reverse it, stop the calls, and show your account current; but that information on your credit report can't be changed."" My credit has been ruined, but my fight has just begun. People, beware of student loans with Sallie Mae! They do not keep accurate records; they change their system frequently so that they can use this as an excuse as to why they don't have a record of your information. They never receive your fax. But with all of the flaws their system have, they are allowed to ruin the life of an American dreamer, such as my self. If the info can be so easily reversed in their system, then why must I suffer for 7-10 years from inaccurate info that is placed on my credit report. Something major needs to be done.

Since she joined the Navy in 2008, Sallie Mae has lost deferment information and harassed us (her parents). She has sent in the completed DD form 2475 twice and Sallie Mae still has no record of it. The agent that I talked to did admit that there was a record of a fax received on July 25th, but claimed that it was not filled out correctly.

I was young and didn't read the fine print. It turns out it's a private or ""signature"" loan with a variable APR. Almost 10 years later with extra payments, I'm down to $6k principal. I feel horrible for the people who loaned 5 times as much as I did. They will never get out from beneath it. Good luck refinancing unless you can get another private loan to do it with. No federal refinancing since it's not a federal loan. I've always paid early and usually with extra towards principal but the one time I messed up a digit on a check, they called the co-signer of my loan and me (in that order) constantly over a measly 64 cents. Yes, seriously, $0.64 missing from a payment. They had to tack on a $20 fine just for the CC payment not to cost them money. Stay away!"

Well, I called last week to let them know I would be paid on Friday and I would call back to make a date. They agreed that I would be on the plan. I called back on Friday and was told by the supervisor that she wasn't going to approve this. After going over a monthly statement of my expenses, I was told that 150 dollars a month was too much to be spending on food! She told me to disconnect my cellphone. When she said I had a disposable income of $300 a month, she told me she wanted that as a payment. I told her no because I have car repairs as well as doctor bills I have to pay, not to mention not having money to pay for gas except to get back and forth from work. She told me, ""People like you who owe us so much money don't deserve to have a life!"" I was in a blind rage. All this happened at work making the rest of my day miserable. They have also called me at work, two weeks after making a payment! They also threatened me to take my co-signer's (my ailing grandfather) house!

I eventually grew tired of the calls during all hours of the day while I was trying to work, and since I was in a different timezone last week, in the very early morning hours, earlier than 7:00 a.m., I took one of the calls. It was a young lady telling me that my account was $400 past due. How was this when it was the 29th of the month and the payment was made earlier in the week? She told me that the extra payment I made went toward interest and not my August payment. I was outraged. I told her to investigate it, fix it, then call me back. Well, they called back alright, over and over and over with a recorded message letting me know I had options for my account and to call a toll free number to speak with someone. My father, who is co-signer on my account, noted seven, yes, seven calls from Sallie Mae on his answering machine yesterday and the calls are still coming today, Labor Day! I tried calling all of the numbers I have for Sallie Mae, but each time the recording says that they are closed today. Then, just minutes ago, I got an automated phone call from them telling me again that I had options and that there was an account representative waiting to speak with me, just call the toll free number.

Everything was going okay until I became permanently disabled. I notified Citibank by phone and they sent me a form to have the loans discharged. I duly completed the form, took it to my doctor to complete his portion, and sent it to Citibank. A few months later, I called them and sure enough, they told me they never received the form. I started to send them a copy of it when I got notification in the mail that the loans had been transferred to Sallie Mae. That's when the real nightmare started. They told me from the start that they never saw or received the loan discharge form I sent to Citibank and that they needed their own form to be filled out anyway. They mailed me the form and I again took it to my doctor. He completed his portion and I completed my portion. The form was completely filled out.About three months later, I hadn't heard anything so I called them and they said that my doctor failed to fill one section and therefore, they couldn't discharge my loan. I was at that point beyond upset and I started making all kinds of phone calls, and I was just transferred to many departments and given the runaround. Then, I received a letter with another form enclosed for my doctor to fill out. And in the meantime, the interest has been accruing and they pushed me into a deferment. I tried to tell them that I didn't need a deferment since the loans should have been discharged long time ago and they said I needed to do it or I would have serious collection problems. My credit has taken a toll by now since my score has dropped considerably and no one will extend credit to me. I hate Sallie Mae. They are incompetent and are involved in misleading business practices and fraud. I'm trying to file a complaint against them to see if I can have these loans discharged once and for all, but haven't been able to find any government agency or department that oversees Sallie Mae to file my complaint. If anyone knows where can I file a complaint against them, would you let me know? And if an attorney wishes to contact me to join the class action, I would be happy to speak to you."

We can't get the form to print from the website. He can't get into his account using the old or new usernames and passwords. The form was to be mailed and never was.

2012-08-25 12:42:57,"Evant, TX",Ronda,1.0,"Three years ago, I learned that I could submit an IBR to Sallie Mae due to media articles about the IBR program. I spent over three hours searching the Sallie Mae website for the information and form. I am wondering how much money they spent in carefully hiding the information on their website. It took two of us with advanced degrees and advanced computer literacy skills to find the information. That being said, I filled the form out and mailed it in along with all requested documents. Three months later, there still was no response. I called. They claimed to have never received it. I resubmitted via USPS with return receipt requested. I received confirmation from USPS that they received it. Three months later, nothing back from Sallie Mae. I called and they couldn't find the info until I threw a huge hissy fit about how they had the information because I had a receipt stating it had been delivered. Miraculously, they found the information. I was processed for an IBR, finally, after lots of follow-up phone calls. Second year, I submitted the information via fax the day after I received the notification requesting a renewal thinking that they couldn't lose it that way. Well, they still managed to lose it. This is disconcerting that my private financial information contained on my tax returns disappears every year into Sallie Mae oblivion. After dealing with them several times via phone again and resending my information, the IBR was finally processed.This is the third year and this time I submitted the information electronically through my online account on their website and now three months has passed (thus ensuring on their part that the IBR has expired) and they never processed the paperwork. Instead, I received this week electronic correspondence showing a change in terms which takes me off of the IBR for which I clearly qualify. I am convinced that they play this little game on purpose in order to circumvent the government regulations regarding the IBR. They are completely unapproachable, uncommunicative, unconcerned, and uncaring. If Sallie Mae were any other corporation or an individual conducting business in this manner, they would be at the very least out of business, under government sanctions, or in jail. Do not use Sallie Mae. You'd be better off with Larry the Loan Shark. He probably has better and more moral business practices."

I expect them to post to my account either Monday or Tuesday (which is insane because I am still accruing daily interest while my payment is pending). I have had a few times where I made a payment and when I checked my account to see if the funds were withdrawn, there is nothing. I called Sallie Mae to see if a payment is pending and am told no. At first, I thought I didn't press submit, or it was my fault, but after this being the 4th time it has happened in the last three months, I find it ridiculous. I plan on writing down my confirmation code in my checkbook now so I can check it. I usually just make a quick payment, but it is now a hassle.Since interest is accrued daily and since some of my payments do not go through, I am paying less to principal and more to interest, which is what Sallie Mae wants. I find myself to be more attuned to what is going on with my student loans than some people. I have also checked to see what the interest should be between my payments and have had times where I am charged more interest. When I bring it to their attention, it gets corrected. Granted, it may be a $1, but still, with the number of borrowers, a $1 here and there adds up quickly in their favor."

2012-08-16 20:24:52,"Lancaster, CA",Jennifer,1.0,"My first issue was getting denied after two years of school for the student loans. Nothing financially had changed, but I had to drop out of school 6 months before graduation and never was able to go back due to these people. I was forced to go back to community college to where Sallie Mae had said as long as I was in classes up to 12 credits, my loans would be deferred until I graduated. That didn't last long. I started getting phone calls multiple times a day about owing them money, so I looked into my monthly payments and they wanted somewhere around $900-$1,500 a month! That was practically my husband's whole paycheck! So since I was unemployed and my husband barely made enough for us to live on, I applied for every deferment I could.Low income payments, unemployment deferment, etc. Denied. I applied again. Denied. I started calling them. Every person I talked to gave me a different story. Either way, the lowest payment they would settle with is around $700-$800 a month. That's more than our rent! At that point, they were auto calling me once an hour. I would answer and no one would be on the line but a machine saying I owe them money and to call this number. After signing one class action suit, the calls had stopped. For a while. Not only are they calling me again all day every day, but they are calling my father as well. Same message as last time. This morning, they called me at 8:21AM. Then again, three minutes later with a different phone number! Same message! What makes it even worse is that they were paid $800 this month and they still feel the need to harass me. It just never stops with them. Ever. Same issue with my husband's loans. His got sent to the collection agency about a year and a half ago, he wheeled, dealt and managed to get a manageable payment plan out of them. About two months ago, his mother called him saying that Sallie Mae had taken a hit off of her credit score (conveniently right as she was applying for a home loan) for late payments, chewing us out for not paying them. So, I had to make a request from the bank to send me a list of every payment we had made to them within the last year! When we proved that there were no late payments, they refused to pull the late fee off of her credit and claimed that they did that because they don't think we are paying enough. Is that even legal? All in all, this company is nothing but a big group of slime balls who will do anything to get money."
2012-08-14 15:19:05,"Passaic, NJ",Diana,2.0,"For many years, I have made payments to Sallie Mae and their subsidiary companies. Now, I received a call from another company stating that I haven't made payments on the student loan. I don't understand why they continue to harass me. Sallie Mae even made a payment arrangement with me of $150.00 to $191.00 a month, which were being deducted from my paycheck. I also made larger payments of approximately $500.00 to $1,200.00. Shame on them! Now, this other company ""Asset Recovery Solutions"" from Illinois is calling and writing me, threatening me with ruining my credit. Furthermore, Sallie Mae and their subsidiary companies made payment bargaining agreements, which I have made, and they still continue to harass. I admit that I was a little negligent during hard times, but I have tried my best to be responsible. I have my copies of all the different transactions that I have made with Sallie Mae. It seems like there's no solution to this problem. Please guide me through this and the most proper procedure to take. I am aware that other people never even had any intentions of paying and they haven't even bothered them. And yet they harass responsible people every single day. Thank you."

Tomorrow, I have to close my account and open another. What a hassle. Plus, there's a 35-dollar overdraft fee. I don't even owe them until October. I wish I could say I'm surprised, but I'm not."
2012-08-10 03:33:10,"Renton, WA",Alan,1.0,"I am losing my job because of Sallie Mae's deceptive practices: I too have an issue with Sallie Mae. I did a loan consolidation for 3% with Sallie Mae in June 2005. After I sent in the paperwork, Sallie Mae dragged their feet on the consolidation. After dragging their feet for several months, Sallie Mae then stated in 3 different letters to me that they have a problem with the consolidation due to ""problem with reference,"" ""having issues with reference,"" or ""lack of references."" That is even though these references are the same references I used to get the student loans through the FAFSA site.First, a letter sent to me from Sallie Mae stated that I had a lack of references. I could not understand this, as I provided two references on the consolidation application like the application requested. Second, another letter I received from Sallie Mae stated they were having issues with my references. So, I updated them online on Sallie Mae's website. I thought things were good. I was wrong. Later on, within a month after updating the references, Sallie Mae then called me on the phone. I again provided the names of my references with addresses to some foreign-speaking person on the phone who stated she works with Sallie Mae and whom I could hardly understand as well as her understanding me. I then received a third letter a few days later that stated ""We tried to contact you by phone for updated references but were unable to reach you."" I just provided this non-English speaking representative at Sallie Mae with all the reference information. What gives. I thought this was some kind of mistake, since it came a couple days after the phone call. So, I ignored it? I heard nothing more after this from Sallie Mae.Any how, after 180 days of being out of school, the loan repayment began. Well, I found out on the first payment that the interest rate was at 7.14%, not at 3%. I contacted Sallie Mae over and over without any success of getting this issue taken care of. I then threatened Sallie Mae that I would withhold payment if this was not taken care of right away and that I was entitled to do this under federal law (Fair Credit Reporting Act). Sallie Mae wrote back promising to correct the issue. The next month, nothing happened. So, I withheld payment and contacted Sallie Mae again and offered to pay what I actually owed. Sallie Mae refused to accept the money I actually owed. After this, the problems started. I had to send certified letters and e-mails (near 100 e-mails) to Sallie Mae. This went on back and forth on the consolidation issue, and Sallie Mae did not want to talk about it anymore. But they did say they did nothing wrong. I was getting nowhere with these idiots. Then after a few months of back and forth e-mails, Sallie Mae took the position that I had defaulted on the loan and sent the collection agencies after me. Eventually, after a year and half of fighting back and forth with Sallie Mae and the many collection agencies, Sallie Mae turned the account over to NSLP as a defaulted loan. Sallie Mae never disclosed to any of the collection agencies or National Student Loan Program that I was disputing this loan because of the interest rate. Sallie Mae stated that it was a noncollectable debt and I had defaulted on the loan.I let NSLP know what was going, and I let the Department of Education know as well. Both stated that they would review the case, but the Department of Education dragged their feet as well way past the time limit that was established to answer my complaint. Only after I complained about them missing the deadline to respond did they answer my complaint unfavorably. NSLP stated they would review the complaint but never followed up at all. I still am waiting on the court review they promised. In 2009, NSLP did a treasury off on my income taxes for $1500.00 and then told the credit bureaus that I owed $80,000.00 when in fact my loans were less than $14,000. I have asked the credit bureaus to remove this information, and I provided proof. Two of the credit bureaus remove the extra money above the $14,000, but Experian did not and refused to remove it. This ended up causing me problems with my job, as I need to hold a security clearance to keep my job. DOD has seen this in my credit file and has held up my clearance (not denying it or approving it). Well, of course, my employer hired someone else and gave me until this October to resolve it or be laid off.So, I contacted Senator Murray, Congressman Adams, and Attorney General McKenna's office to get them involved and help resolve this issue. Both legislators and Attorney General wrote letters to Salle Mae, and Sallie Mae denied any wrongdoing. I then provided written copies of the correspondences between Sallie Mae and I showing that Sallie Mae offered to correct the issue. Neither legislator has done a follow up and has done little to nothing to help out so far. Attorney General McKenna did the most foot work but stated that their hands are tied and I would need to sue. Now, I have hired an attorney and I am filing a lawsuit for damages.I do feel for all of you out there. My advice for others facing similar issues is to get your self an attorney before it's too late and it causes other problems like losing your job or loss of your income tax return check. I'm faced with losing my job here soon, as I have been having issues getting a security clearance because of these student loans on my credit report. My suggestion is to contact an attorney who does consumer protection law or something similar. Sallie Mae currently has a class action lawsuit pending against them in the 9th District Federal Court for phone harassment and robo calls. I just wish Congress or the President would do something useful for once in their freaking lives. I hope this helps anyone who needs the help."

They call you about ""late payments"" that are not late and when you inform them you received an email confirming the payments, they fail to apologize for their error, but go on and on about other ways to pay off your loan. They must have a quota on the number of calls to make a day. Keep a folder with confirmation of payments and name of persons you talk to - you will need it."

Unbeknownst to me, she sought and received multiple forbearance as well as made a change in the terms of the loan to make it interest only payments. Sallie Mae is now trying to make me accountable for $22,000 in added interest. My question is, can they change the terms and conditions of the loan without any approval or agreement from me? It would seem they have violated the original terms of the consigned agreement."

No one there, but to get a person, you have to submit your account information and then you're told ""This call may be recorded for quality purposes."" What? Are you kidding me? None of us can continue to waste time with this loan provider. Their customer service platform is broken and deficient. I've always made my payments on time, yet they have reported me to credit agencies. This should be against the law."

2012-07-12 14:33:07,"South Boston, MA",Lindsay,1.0,"We refinanced our house in order to pay off my Sallie Mae loans. The number of hoops that we had to jump through in order to even have them accept a check was ridiculous. Our lawyer overpaid the loan by $56, and when I called Sallie Mae to find out when they would be mailing a check to us for the overpayment, they told me 30-45 days. Every other loan we paid off was 7 business days to get an overpayment check! I called Sallie Mae to find out what the issue was and was told that they would expedite the process. A few hours later, they called and left a message that they wanted an additional letter from our bank stating that the money had come out of our account. The account has been paid off and posted as closed for weeks by Sallie Mae, but yet they are now asking for another letter?! Outrageous. As usual they will be holding on to my money for additional time and collecting more interest as each day passes.The only silver lining is that my business with them is finished. I feel badly for anyone who has been roped into thinking that Sallie Mae is there to help students in need. They're crooks, plain and simple and just as dirty as any of the scumbags from JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs."
2012-07-11 21:40:25,"Wheat Ridge, CO",Ginny ,1.0,"I started attending the Art Institute of Colorado almost 9 years ago. I was 19 at the time. AIC allowed me to only use Sallie Mae for financing. I had a cosigner for one year, and the rest was up to me. I ended up taking out 6 loans, private and federal. My private loans have sky-high interest. I was a sitting duck to them, less than a year from graduating, young, lied to by the school about lender options, and with no cosigner. I was given an 11% variable interest rate and was told that that variable could go down to what my federal loans were, around 6%. One of my 6 loans originated $13,000, and today (6 years later) at eleven percent interest, I owe over $28,000 on that one loan. By trying to finance my last year of school to graduate, I promised them tens of thousands of dollars in interest only.I still did not have enough credit/money to pay for my last year of school, and that $13,000 did not get me far enough. I had to take time off and just work. We started our family and are living on one income, which is possible because we have minimized our wants and have everything we need. I keep my loans in deferment all the time. Federal loans are in deferment; private are in forbearance.After we had our first baby, day care was impossible, because it cost us more than what I was making. I told Sallie Mae I was not working outside of the home and needed some help with repayment. I told them what I could afford monthly. They said they would not accept it. I could either make interest-only payments (which were still twice what I could afford) or put them in forbearance. Forbearance it was. Finally, about a year and a half ago, they started telling me I could do economic hardship deferment or unemployment deferment. They consider me unemployed, but I raise my kids full time, because we cannot afford day care here on what I was making outside of the home. If you remember, I could not finish my degree due to financing. I work a harder job with longer hours raising my kids than I did as a nanny, but with zero dollars in pay. Happy to do it, but it doesn't count to SM as working. I have hoop after hoop to jump through to prove I am seeking full-time employment, etc. I asked for the forms to be sent to my house, and they would never come. This allowed them to put me in forbearance to buy time to keep promising to send me the forms or misdirect me online, and I never receive hardship deferment. Almost two years after they were under penalty of law to disclose hardship repayment options, I have yet to get the right form from them or have them process correctly my paperwork. I am currently in forbearance.Today, we are planning to sell our home to pay off Sallie Mae. This is the home we restored from the floors up and raised babies in. We realize we might not make too much money on it, but we need to get Sallie Mae off our backs so we can move on with our life. What I have offered SM is this:- I have not paid them more than $100 since taking loans out from them.- I am offering them a full payoff of what I financed upon selling our home.- I have asked them to consider adjusting the interest rates so that we can pay off what I owe entirely, with no effort on their end to find a meeting ground. All they say is ""No. You signed the promissory note promising 11% interest, and that is what you owe us."" There's no room for negotiation.To me, what I'm offering is fair. I am willing to negotiate to maybe 5% (which is still nuts!) and be able to pay them far more than what I borrowed to get an education. They said to me ""You're one of hundreds of calls we get like this a day."" To me, that should say something - that we valued an education, chose SM to finance, and are willing and maybe even able to pay them what we borrowed and then some, if they are willing to meet in the middle! It makes no sense to me! It hurts, physically, to lie my head down at night knowing what I've taken from my sweet family by financing my education with Sallie Mae.I realize being able to sell an asset to take care of the debt is a giant blessing. It should probably feel better than it does. But I am not willing to take the roof out from above our heads in order to pay the robbers at Sallie Mae a dime more than what I'm offering for negotiating. It is more than in their favor. I'm not asking for a favor, for loan forgiveness, or for a handout. I'm just asking for what is right and just. They are predators, and they need to be stopped. I don't know where else to go for support. I can reach no one of importance on the phone, and I have a hard time wanting to call them because the reps are so rude; they're so bullying. I have had one person with Sallie Mae be nice to me on the phone in all of the years of working with them. It makes me sick to know that I am one of probably hundreds of thousands that Sallie Mae is doing this to. Where is our relief. The government needs to step in, since they're the ones who bailed out their parent companies anyway. I'm so sick about this, for all of us who have a relationship with Sallie Mae."
2012-07-10 06:45:26,"Park Forest, IL",Emily,1.0,"Over the course of the past year, Sallie Mae has: (1) applied payment to loans not due and then attempted to charge me a late fee; (2) ignored the memo line on my checks and applied payments unevenly; (3) applied payments to wrong accounts entirely and then attempted to charge me a late fee; and (4) electronically removing the wrong amount from my account despite what was written on the check and then attempted to charge me a late fee. Additionally, I reapplied for income-based repayment as soon as they sent me the form to renew it. It was rejected because I was still under income-based repayment and I was told they would send me another form. They never did and now they want $400 that I do not have. This is the eighth time I've faced predatory servicing from this company and it's impacting my ability to sleep at night. I have had to jump through hoops to get these errors resolved."
2012-07-07 03:50:41,"Sandusky, OH",Amanda,1.0,"Unlike many people, my parents are paying back my loans as my father promised to pay for my college as long as I got my degree. Since graduating in 2006, they have been making the payments on mine and before that, they were making interest payments on ones in their name. Back at the end of December 2011, my father was forced to resign from his job of 32 years. Unemployment and social security only pays so much and he can only draw a certain amount without losing his social security. He's still trying to find even a part time job. Sallie Mae would not help out with hardship deferments, nothing unless we fell behind (or so they say on the phone but friends from college have told me otherwise). So, my parents have figured out how to keep paying them and the rest of the must-have bills without going hungry. It works out. Well, I got a phone call today from my mother. She's on vacation out of state and is always the one who makes sure the bills get paid. She missed Sallie Mae, so she called me (no computer with her) and asked me to go on and tell them we would send it on the 10th. Then, she changed her mind, said to post it to hit her account on the 11th (when her check gets deposited) for not just the late payment but also next month's payment that was showing as due also. Then this evening, I got a call, ""They've called me 6 times about the payment. Can you call them since they won't talk to me and see what's going on?"" I called, thinking it didn't show up yet on the computer as it's going to be pulled on the 11th and get told that where the computer shows this, it won't stop the calls till the payment posts. I asked about the 6 calls in one day to the same number and each call was answered and was told that yes, the system is set to call many times in one day to which I asked if they thought a person would magically get the money in between the calls. ""Sorry for the inconvenience,"" was all I got, not a ""I'll tell my supervisor or anything."" Of course, I had to tell her that maybe just maybe this was part of the reason that those that did borrow from them regretted it and hated dealing with them. I was somewhat forced to use them. The loans I had starting out with a company weren't enough to cover the full costs and they couldn't approve more. My financial aid adviser told us this was a great company and that most students at Harding University used them. And we all hate that we did/do."
2012-07-06 01:06:33,"Lakehurst, NJ",Eduardo,1.0,"I took out a student loan in 2005 through Sallie Mae to attend Full Sail. This one supposed loan was divided up in 4 loans (2 Fed/2 private) with different interest rates - one as high as 7% on $30k. Originally, I only owed approximately $40k, but with interest, it has raised to $80k pretty much double and I was on educational forbearance between 2006-2009 and was still being charged interest. In 2011, I got a decent job and was able to make a year's worth of payments, but lost the job and only collecting unemployment, which is barely enough to cover my bills. Sallie Mae has flip flopped and 3 months ago, said I still had time (about 9 months) to apply for forbearance or deferment, allowing me time to get back on my feet. After a 3-month forbearance, they told me there's no more time left on my account. Unable to pay, they offered no help whatsoever. All they do is harass with letters and phone calls (about 4 a day), which I don't answer because I know it will end up with Sallie Mae not helping out its customer and them not receiving their money. Truth is, I'm not benefiting from the education I received at Full Sail. Albeit entertaining and informative, received no assistance after graduation and haven't worked in what I studied a day in my life. The jobs I can get only pay so much and not enough for me to afford the payments that Sallie Mae is requesting. I'm stuck on not being able to pay, agencies telling me they can't help me out at all with my private loans and my good credit going away. I have no problem paying my federal loans. I believe I only owe $8k with low interest and a reasonable payment amount. The majority of my problem is with the private loans, which apparently, no one can help with. Go figure. If there is any lawyer reading this that they can help or advise me, please do. No agencies or financial counselors seem to want to help me, only telling me to call Sallie Mae and work out something with them, which is impossible. I have not been reported to the credit bureaus yet, but soon will be (shortly, as Sallie Mae puts it). I hope there is something that can come out of this complaint and the government can regulate this fraud of a bank. They shouldn't be allowed to lend money whatsoever."
2012-06-30 03:45:05,"Shawnee, KS",Jeanie,1.0,"I am upset that private loans have all the privileges and protections of a normal government loan, i.e. they do not have to follow fair credit debt collection practices, cannot be included in bankruptcy, etc. However, they get the additional freedom of not having the regulations regarding working with the borrower and arranging fair payment practices. I am now in my sixth month of my loan showing delinquent in that each month I have set up an arrangement with Sallie Mae to bring the loan to a current status and each month, Sallie Mae customer service admits their representatives did not dot an i or cross a t, and we need to start the paperwork again. They need some type of regulation and outside agency we can bring our grievances to for a fair investigation. I think I just formed my comment. I recently learned that last year, a government agency was set up to look at the student loan industry including private loans. They also are also taking comments regarding private loans until August 13 2012. I only see 4 comments to date. I have been asking for awhile if there is any government agency looking into private loans and Sallie Mae doesn't seem to want to share. I am formatting a comment to add to the site and it would be sad if only four comments are there to form a recommendation to Congress regarding private loans."
2012-06-26 22:53:07,"Washington, DC",julia,2.0,"I have been mad at Sallie Mae ever since May 2007, the date I graduated. I had been getting all these letters about how I really needed to consolidate to lock in special interest rates. So, I called and had them consolidate everything, but didn't see the rate until after they had me sign all sorts of papers. Maybe it was in the fine print, but representatives made it seem like I really needed to do this. I get the papers back - this is after I was 'locked in', only to see that they converted my 6% APR loan to 10%, and with no way out of it. They told me I was 'locked in'. The worst company ever!"

It is my son's loan which I signed off on because I wanted him in college. He did not finish and I understand that a court in Ohio actually found in favor of a student who did not finish. I want them to leave my family and friends alone. It has nothing to do with them. I was sorry that I ever started this mess and won't make the same error with my grandson. Maybe college is just a farce here.
2012-06-25 18:05:28,"New York, NY",Kathryn,1.0,"I was forced to use Sallie Mae when I was in college because I did not have a co-signer and they were basically the only ones that would give me money to get through school. The rates are ridiculous. They make it actually impossible for people/students to actually get out of debt and even make a living after they graduate. I would have been better off struggling and working through school and finishing slower rather than borrowing money from them.On top of that, their website doesn't allow you to make payment with a credit card so you have to call and be charged $15 every time you make a payment, and they don't allow you to set up auto pay unless it's a bank account. This being said, I have someone who is helping me pay my loans but it's a process every time I go to make a payment, and they screw me out of even more money instead of putting a credit/debit card payment option on their website.Sallie Mae is unfortunately not the best way to go about paying for school, and leaves many people stuck in debt forever, which isn't right. Hopefully, some time down the road, this will be put to an end. I'm lucky to have someone now who helps me but if it weren't for that, Sallie Mae would be costing me my life because I would not be able to support myself or my family and pay them back. By the time I actually pay it all off, it will more than double and that's if I make all my payments on time. People don't even make enough money with a college degree anymore to pay this off, better off not even going to college in my opinion."
2012-06-24 22:45:36,"Boise, ID",Diana,1.0,"I had a student loan in the early 1990s with Sallie Mae and was so pleased with the service I received. In 2009 I found myself laid off and decided to go back to school to make myself more marketable. I took out a small loan ($5000) with Sallie Mae. Please note: I was making small auto debit payments while in school for a show of good faith and to reduce the interest on the loan. Cut to May of 2012 - my grace period on the loan would be ending in July 2012. Being employed only part time and not having any luck finding another part-time position or a full-time job, I started contacting Sallie Mae asking about my options for repayment or for deferment. What a nightmare! I have spoken to so many different people in so many different parts of the world and have not been told the same thing twice ever! One rep will tell me one thing and the next one will tell a completely different thing! Every time I have asked to speak to a supervisor, I am hung up on or told they are not available and they will call me back. To date, this has never happened.One representative had the nerve to tell me to not pay rent in order to make my student loan payment when it came due. Another said that I didn't have a choice but to make my payments or they would send me to collections. Why is it that by being a responsible consumer, contacting Sallie Mae before my loan payments are due and seeking alternatives, I am told no straight up? My federal loans have been deferred due to underemployment. Why can't Sallie Mae at least offer the option to reduce payments? In a word - disgusted."
2012-06-21 16:05:31,"Atlanta, GA",Dorthina,1.0,"In November 2006, I consolidated my Sallie Mae student loans with a company called Great Lakes. Great Lakes then sold the loan to ECMC in August 2008. I also filed a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy in August 2008, but continued to make payments to ECMC through the trustee's disbursements on my student loan. In all, I made 30 payments, totaling $10,726.84. My Chapter 13 closed early this year and shortly afterwards, I received a letter from Sallie Mae indicating that they had re-purchased the loan. Absolutely none of the payments on my student loan, which were made to ECMC on during the 3+ years that I was in bankruptcy, had been credited. When I first emailed Sallie Mae, I was asked to provide documentation. I sent them a package of documents by certified mail, return receipt requested. I received the return receipt with their stamp and the date they received it, May 18. I waited and waited. Then on June 7, I called to ask why I hadn't heard anything. At first, I was told that they hadn't received the documents. Then, when I said I was holding the certified return receipt with their date stamp, I was put on hold for about 10 minutes, then told that they had received the documents, but it would take 21 business days for someone to review and respond to me. Someone from Sallie Mae left a message on my home phone on June 19 asking me to call them. I called today and was again told that the documents had not been received, even though I said that I had the certified return receipt. I was asked to fax the documents in, and it would take about 7 days to review and get back with me. At this point, I am very upset with Sallie Mae because it seems to me that I'm getting a royal runaround. I can't imagine them re-purchasing the loan at the original amount and not being told that payments had been received on it, especially considering the amount of the payments. I am totally disgusted."

Six months in a row, I called them and spent time going through the same information only to be told all was fine and it was their mistake! The next month, it happens all over again!

Nothing was done, my mother and I got harassing phone calls and letters. They looked for me everywhere, called my new job and was going to garnish my wages and threatened my mother because she was the co-signer. Worst customer service and loan company. I wish I never took out a loan with them. I have been paying my loans and they seem to increase, not decrease. The loan amount seem to stay the same and the interest always changes. Sallie Mae does not do anything about how payments are processed, etc. I asked numerous friends and they feel the same way. Their Sallie Mae loans seem to stay the same and it seems like the money we all make each month is going somewhere else. If you are looking for a school loan, do not go with Sallie Mae; they are scammers and will give you a hard time.

It takes a special person to work there but I recently lost my job of 8 years. I didn't receive unemployment and I'm a single father. I called Sallie Mae and told them what happened and, of course, they demanded their money. I have both private and Fed loans. The Fed loan was easy to take care of, but the private, no! I worked my ** off paying them monthly and on time too. I've been unemployed for 7 months and they defaulted my loans.  I asked if I could have a deferment; I was told no. And every time I've spoken with them, they acted like they don't have any information from previous calls. I recently spoke with them and they said if I could come up with $8k, I can be put in the program. My payments would be $300 and my interest would be super low. That's great! But you missed the part where I don't have a job(!), telling me to ask family for the money. If I have family to give me $8k, do you think I would need a loan for school? I look at it like this. If my payment history has been great all these years, there's nothing you can do to help out. Now, my credit is getting burnt and I owe enough money to put a down payment on a house. If I knew it would be like this, I would have never gone to college. And the fact that they asked me to put myself in more debt just blows my mind. The government needs to step in and put an end to the loan sharking. It's funny how they take our money to bail out banks but we have our lives destroyed and no one to help us. And my credit card company has shown more love, just for the fact I pay on time, they were willing to work with me during this time. Shame. Any info or help will be greatly welcome."

On September 9, 2011, I was contacted by Allied Interstate regarding a one-time settlement offer to pay off the private loan with Sallie Mae. I was unemployed and was laid off my job in February. Allied Interstate, Inc. representing Sallie Mae said that if I sent them $2,800.00, the private loan debit will be forgiven. I begged and borrowed from my family to pay them and have my promissory letter stating paid in full.Sallie Mae keeps telling me that I still owe them for my student loan. I tried calling Allied Interstate but somehow, they see my number and it goes directly into a voicemail. I have left several messages for them to please straighten this out with Sallie Mae. No one called me back. They got my money and that's all they cared about.I keep getting calls from Sallie Mae and I keep trying to explain to them what transpired, but they don't get it. They will argue at a brick wall. I once had a supervisor threaten me and when I asked her, ""Who do you think you are?"" She said, ""We are Sallie Mae!"" When I told her I was taping the conversation, she went berserk! They will not listen to what I have to say because they are always right - when I know for a fact that they are dead wrong. Why is America letting this giant do these things and get away with it? I hate the day I even heard the name Sallie Mae!"

2012-05-24 18:32:01,"Mesa, AZ",Jaime,1.0,"In sum, I owe SM about $2700 between two loans. One has a balance of about $400 and the other is $2300. I have been consistently making payments (which always fluctuate and I seriously can't make sense of their billing structure - I just pay). In May 2012, I tried to apply for a home loan only to be told that one of my SM loans was delinquent for 60-90 days! I logged into my SM account and found out that they had only been applying my payments to one of my loans, causing, of course, the other loan to be severely delinquent. As a result, my credit report basically plummeted to an embarrassing 559! I was near 700 before. My finance person with the home loan told me if SM adjusted these payments and gave me a written notice that I had not technically been delinquent, she could do a rapid rescore and hopefully get me approved.  This was 9 days ago and I've spoken with SM approximately 7 times as follows: Call 1) The rep told me I was delinquent, so I made a payment. I asked for documentation of this payment. She refused, saying it wasn't their policy. Call 2) I requested my April 2012 payments to be redistributed to both of my loans instead of just one. The rep refused, saying that wasn't possible. Call 3) I requested again for the payments to be redistributed and SM complied, causing my accounts to come out of delinquent status. I asked for documentation and he stated it was their policy to mail this information. Call 4) I called again, spoke with an alleged supervisor who took my fax number, and read aloud a fax she would be sending, something to the effect of ""Jaime was not delinquent on her accounts in 2012."" She promised that it would arrive in 1-2 business days. This was a Wednesday.Call 5) After waiting patiently for four business days, I called back, only to be told that my account was 20 days delinquent. I had made this payment already, but it hadn't posted to their system. I asked to speak with a supervisor and the call was disconnected. Suspicious. Call 6) I called back immediately and was told to hold for collections as my account was delinquent. I told the rep, forcefully, that I was not delinquent and was calling about a different issue entirely. I asked to be connected to a supervisor and again the call was disconnected. Call 7) I called back immediately, understandably livid, and explained to the rep how patient I had been waiting for them to fulfill their verbal promise. She connected me to a supervisor who told me that the original notice was in fact mailed, not faxed. So, that supervisor I spoke with during call 4 was a liar. This supervisor told me that he would submit the request for my fax and I would receive it in 1-2 days.That was 3 days ago. No fax was received. So, as a result, I am in limbo with home financing, the seller on my potential house is getting impatient, my finance lady is impatient, and Sallie Mae has seriously screwed everything up. I am not surprised that there are hundreds of negative reviews for this ridiculous company. I am so thankful I only have $2,700 left to pay to them so I can get rid of their disgusting practices in a fairly timely manner. In the meantime, I'm about to call their severely incompetent customer service unit again with hopes of getting them to follow through on their promise to send this notice of my non-delinquency so that I have a place to live. Thanks for your time."

I don't know the persons name that I spoke to today but I also spoke to a supervisor by the name of Rob **. I also told them that my son said that he is sending a payment by next week. Right now, my stress level is about 100%, trying to take care of my husband 24/7, without them calling and harassing.

Well, they tell me a few days ago (May 2012) that there was an ""error"" and I shouldn't have been placed in that program and now the payment due is over $600! I could barely afford the $50 - I work less than 30 hrs a week and am seeking more employment but it's hard to come by. I don't know what to do! It's about 70 days overdue or such by what the website document is telling me and I am freaking out! I just need a helping hand. I'm not trying to duck out of it! I just want to be able to eat, that's all. They even suggested that I stop paying rent, my car payment, etc. This company is horrible!

2012-04-21 01:21:39,"Indianapolis, IN",Antoinette ,1.0,"My experience with Sallie Mae has been absolutely horrible. It started when a family member offered to pay my student loans off. He and I contacted Sallie Mae to discuss whether or not we could negotiate the amount. After being transferred 5 times, the customer service rep from the Philippines informed us that we would need to view the information about a closed school or a dispute in the amount. I went to the website provided and saw that I could file the dispute due to the original disbursement amounts not matching. Sallie Mae had different amounts of money disbursed than what the school had. The amount totaled $3,148.42. I filled out the paper work and met with the director of financial aid at the college I attended. He also agreed that there was a discrepancy and sent in a letter to Sallie Mae telling them I was in my rights in requesting a meeting to discuss this issue. I faxed this information in February 2011 and have not heard back from Sallie Mae. I have then proceeded to call the CSR line repeatedly asking to speak to their ""back office"" aka United States Yet, I again have never been contacted. I have been pleasant, I have been angry, I have been emotional but it gets me nowhere. I then decided I was not making any more payments until someone contacted me. I know this is risky but what really do I have to lose? I make payments and they seem to do nothing to the balance or the interest. I will never be able to pay this off. It is amazing how you attempt to make a better life by going to college and you are left with so much debt that nothing you do seems to matter. I believe the actions of Sallie Mae are questionable. I do not understand that if a person wants to pay their loan off and are disputing $3,000 to the $27,000 amount owed what it matters. They will still be receiving the amount they gave me to attend school and more than $4,000 in interest. This is unethical and how they are continuing to get away with this is beyond my comprehension. At some point, the United States government will have to step in or the majority of the country will be in debt due to student loans which will cause a larger issue with the economy than could ever seem possible."

I have evidence and the IP address of where the individual used to process the loan. They call me by the individuals name and his date of birth.

I have six different student loans, and they have different interest rates, but the loans are all consolidated and I pay one fee each month. There was one loan with a higher interest rate, and I wanted to pay it off completely, so a customer service person separated out that loan for me, and I paid it off. However, when she did that, she took me off automatic bill pay and never put me back on. I missed one payment (because I thought I was on automatic bill pay), and my interest rates were raised. I have called numerous times over the past four months to try to get this issue resolved, always with the customer service person promising that they will personally make sure that the problem is resolved, but so far it hasn't been solved.

I have a letter from SM that describes the transfer of the loan and it even says ""outstanding late fees 0.00"". Those in Customer Service are, shall we say, less than intelligent and I demanded to be transferred to someone who knew what they were doing and this person wasn't any better. So how can Citibank, all of a sudden, be wanting to collect any and why 5 months later?! Any time I've tried to pay extra on my loan(s), it never goes to the principal  - always ends up on interest. I will never pay these loans off and I think that is the point of how they they perform their business practices. I am so disgusted by the things that I have read on this site of the things SM has done to people. I wish there were some way to get my loans out of there!"

The only phone call I have received from Sallie Mae since the summer of 2011 has been from the manager who told me that they were applying the payments for September, October, and November 2011 to my account. Sallie Mae still states there is a balance due that does jive with my current payments due, leaving me suspicious that there may be more payments not properly posted to my account. With Sallie Mae refusing to respond to my multiple written, faxed, and emailed requests, I am unable to determine how the money ""owed"" is being calculated or where it is directly coming from. To add to this, Sallie Mae keeps listing my account in default, but when I call, they will not resolve the matter with me. They are berating, snide, and threatening, when I am trying to resolve the matter. I have the right to question the account. My questions should be answered without beratement, threats to call the co-signer, judgment comments, or flat out refusal to answer my questions. At this point, I believe that Sallie Mae is deliberately trying to place the account in default because of the continued refusal to cooperate with me with regard to answering my questions about how my account is being handled. For example, I can place three calls in a row trying to settle the matter, and not one call will result in the answers to my questions. Then I follow up by written letter, fax, and email."

2012-04-06 15:44:13,"Bridgeport, OH",Richard,1.0,"My problems began with Sallie Mae, after I co-signed a loan for my sister. She had a business go under and went through a divorce, forcing her to file bankruptcy. When this happened, Sallie Mae, with no prior contact to me, consolidated her loan into my account. I have two student loans of my own with them. They were charging me late fees and calling my house and employer up to ten times a day. After a lot of patience and phone calls, I found a rep willing to help me. We got the problem resolved by placing the loans on two separate bills. My original two loans and my sister's on the other. My payment is $196.00 a month, and hers is $171.00. At the time, there were two account numbers; and without warning, they eliminated my sister's account number. She was making payments, and they had no clue where her money was going. So what they did to me when I made my $196.00 payment is disburse my money over the three loans, underpaying my two loans. Then they would charge late fees on three loans. I then placed another phone call to customer service to track down her money and find out why I was being charged late fees. They said they would look into it and that I would hear from them shortly. The rep did call me back. She set up the account into two separate bills and told me to put my account number on my check with a -1 at the end of it and my sister was to put a -2 at the end of her account. The rep also gave me a phone number, so I could talk to her directly. My payments were placed as they should for a while, then they started up again with spreading the payments out again  The phone calls started up again. I called the rep who helped me, and the person who answered asked me how I got the number that I called. I asked for the person who helped me, and they would not let me talk to her and promptly hung up on me. The very next day, I got a phone call from a rep from their Wisconsin call center, and I told the lady I was being harassed by her company. She got hostile with me and told me that I was not being harassed and that I needed to just pay my bills. I told her I wanted to speak to her supervisor and was hung up on. I tried to get on the website to file a complaint and was blocked out of it. After making a few phone calls again, I was able to talk to a rep to get things straightened out again. I was assured that it was going to be taken care of and a change was made to my account number to reflect where the payments were to go. I got a letter from them which said they reviewed my account and the payments were applied back to where they needed to be. This month's statement reflected something much different. I was able to go the the website and found out that even though my payments have never been late, I have been charged late fees every month since October. My payment is not due till the 28th of each month, and I make my payment on the 19th of each month. This company is like a revolving door. Just when you think things are ok, they come right back at you. I wish there was a way to file charges against their practices. I am so sick of the phone calls and the harassment. They have destroyed my once solid credit rating, which is now a very low score."

He claimed he is paying $200 a month on one group of loans and $400 on another (seven loans altogether). I tried to call Sallie Mae this morning. I have talked to three people, all offshore. They didn't seem to know what they're doing. I was trying to ask the woman the first time if she could tell whether he's paying on these loans or not. She kept saying things like, ""you'll just have to keep paying on the loans"" or ""is he paying the loans?"". I simply can't seem to get things through their head. This company is so dumb.

I have to explain to her what an e-signature is because she repeats to me that I didn't sign my 1040. She has no idea what I am even talking about, as she must not have used a computer ever. So after trying to educate her on Sallie Mae paperwork and lowering payment options her company has offered me, she said she would send an email to have my application reprocessed, which is essentially what the other two reps have already done. I asked her if there was any way at all she can contact the processing center and tell them which page the e-signature page is, so it won't be looked over again; and she said, ""No, we can't talk to them, except through email."" Once again, I am shaking in my boots, because if I have to pay a huge loan payment, I won't be able to make my bills for the month because of their lack of competence or ability to provide any sort of customer service beyond sending an email and talking to me in their recorded voices. I am now going to fax in another copy of my IBR application with a different form besides my 1040 to see if they will process it correctly a different way. If I am going to have to go through this for the next 30 years, I am going to go crazy."
2012-04-01 04:25:23,"Brentwood , ca",Heinz,1.0,"I co-signed for a friend with the assumption that after 15 months with on time payments that my name would be removed from the loan. After 15 months, I called and was told it had to be 24 months before the removal of my name. Well after 24 months when I called, I filled out the paper work and turned it in. Now they tell me that her credit score is not quite high enough and to try again in 60 days. This is a scam and there was never a mention of a credit score even though she has made all her payments to Sallie Mae on time. I will never ever do business with these scam artists again! Watch out for this trap from Sallie Mae."
2012-03-27 20:24:50,"Walland, TN",Barbara ,1.0,"My daughter has a student loan with Sallie Mae. She lives in London, UK and in order for he to make her payments we had to set up a bank account here in the USA. The account is in both her name and my husband's name. While she was doing her PhD. work she requested and thought she had received a deferment on her loan. However, because the bank account is also in his name my husband checks it regularly. We noticed that Sallie Mae had been deducting payments from the account. So in order to help our daughter we have made certain that there are sufficient funds to cover these deductions. But the really odd thing is that having made the deduction at the beginning of the month, Sallie Mae returns it the beginning of the following month and within a matter of days, makes the same deduction again. Now on top of this, last Saturday, our daughter received an automated ""do not reply"" email from Sallie Mae stating that she is several months in default on the loan and that she needed to immediately make up the missing months of payments as well as pay a large late fee. None of this makes any sense. They take her money to use a month at a time without giving her account any credit. Also, during which time the money is not available to her or us. Then they turn around, practically force her to default, by requesting an outrageous sum. On top of everything, charge her for being late. And of course, she can never get a hold of anybody at Sallie Mae and no one will talk to us since we are not, thank God, cosigners and therefore, not legal parties to the loan. Has anybody had a similar situation and is there anything we can do about it? Her whole experience with Sallie Mae has been a nightmare and being overseas only makes it worse. She didn't expect SM to accept British currency, but they wouldn't accept a check in American dollars from a branch of Citibank in London. She has literally spent hours on the phone just waiting to talk to someone. But we really question the legality of their latest stunt."

I called the customer advocate and requested the calls to stop. They stopped and so did any contact with them. No billing statements, no online account access, etc. Nothing. They changed the monthly amount due without telling me. I had no idea what to pay. They even put my loans in default without telling me. I only knew by a letter from the collection agency. After they denied me access to my own account, they almost doubled the amount of my loans with fees and interest. Then they conveniently placed it in default to get the tax write-off and placed it in collections with a company that they are affiliated with. It is all a big scam and the students are the victim. I will be talking to an attorney later this week to see about getting something done with my credit report and help in dealing with Sallie Mae. They change the rules to suit them at any given moment. They refuse to put anything in writing. I can't even get a straight answer. I was even told that my late payment amount that I owe Sallie Mae continues to grow even if I make payments to the collection agency, because Sallie Mae still expects their original regularly scheduled monthly payments sent to them also! Our government gave them a big bailout so they could continue to screw us. Where is our rights? Where are our federal representatives and senators? Anyone interested in a class action lawsuit?"

The monies posted from the last payment they showed in 11/10 made her payments through February of 2012. So now they show her as delinquent. She and my mother (a cosigner on one of her loans) get threatening letters and phone calls daily. I have called three times a week every week since March 1st, 2012 up to Friday March 23rd, 2012. I have spoken to at least 17 different people, and to this day, they can not get this payment posted.

For many years, I have been making payments in excess of my ""minimum due"" to pay down the principal balance on my loans. Sallie Mae's general practice is to apply additional funds to the next payment, rather than to the principle balance. For the last 4-5 months, Sallie Mae has required that I make the overpayment, and then wait 2-4 days for the payment to post and then call them back to have my overpayment applied to the principle balance. I have called back each month, met resistance from front line agents, and then had my excessive payments moved to apply to principle balances only after demanding a supervisor.Of note, sometime between March 15th and March 25th, Sallie Mae put a new option on their website to ""apply overpayment to principal"". This must be the result of similar complaints or a pending law suit. I do not have a good interest rate, 7.5%. So every principal dollar counts! If I could move my loans back to Citi or any other lender with reasonable payment options, I would do so in a heartbeat. However, after contacting the govt. student loan support agency, I was told that I did not have any option in the matter, aside from taking out a personal loan or moving the debt to a credit card."

2012-03-19 15:08:26,"Odenton, MD",Lisa,1.0,"Late 2011, with no real notice, I was informed Sallie Mae now owns my Student loan. I had years with Citigroup and no problems. I was set up on the electronic email bill notice and would pay each month with no problems. As soon as Sallie Mae took over, they allowed me to do the same electronic notice and payment and then with no notice switched it to paper. I travel often and my mail sits and now my payments are late. I switched back to electronic payments but they never inform me that the payment is due via email. Instead, they insist on sending paper. I just went through the process again to switch it to email notification, but now I've been penalized for late payments. Where is their accountability? It feels more like bait and switch so they can collect late fees. I really hate Sallie Mae. How can I switch to a respectable loan holder?"
2012-03-14 19:29:29,"Fort Worth, TX",Lawanna ,1.0,"In Dec 2011, I set up payment arrangements with Sallie Mae. On Jan 3, the first payment came out as scheduled and planned, my scheduled payments were Jan 3rd, Feb 25th, March 24th and April 21st. On Jan 31, they took another (unauthorized) payment out which sent my account into overdraft. I contacted Sallie Mae of the error on their part and asked for them to put the money back as well as send a letter to my bank explaining their error, so my bank would refund all of the overdraft fees I received due to the unauthorized payment. I received a letter a few days later telling me that they would not put the money back nor send the letter to my bank and that they had the right to take the money out. I then cancelled my bank card so they would not take any more unauthorized payments out of my account. They tried again the first week of Feb to take another unauthorized payment out. When it would not go through, I started getting threatening and rude phone calls from Sallie Mae. I again tried to explain to Salle Mae what had happened and told them since why they did not return the unauthorized payment that was taken in Jan that they needed to apply that payment to my Feb payment. They told me that was not how they did business, they then accused me of not making payments and that they did not receive payments that they had already received. I sent them copies of my bank statements confirming that they did receive two payments in January (one in which they were not supposed to take out and they just got into my account and took it) and again contacted my bank and did further research on it. I was again told that yes the money did come out of my account and was paid to Sallie Mae. I told Sallie Mae of this again and asked for the fax number of the person I was speaking to, so I could fax the information to her and was told, no they didn't want it. At one point, they spoke to my mother as well, and also called her a liar and were very disrespectful and rude to her. They treated me very rudely and are a very unethical, immoral and unprofessional company. People need to be made aware of Sallie Mae's lack of business ethics and unprofessionalism."

They insist on you providing them with confidential information such as birth date and social security number before they will talk to you. When you refuse to provide them with that confidential information, they say that they can not talk to you but then keep calling you - phone harassment. They refused to extend my son's loan even though he remains unemployed after graduation, causing us to make his payments. We have made the payments, but they continue to call and harass us."
2012-03-10 21:19:43,"Wooster, OH",Billie,1.0,"In 2010, I received notice from Sallie Mae that my student loan was in default. I tried several times to make financial arrangements with them. I explained that I was disabled &amp; my only source of income was my disability check. They sent me paperwork numerous times that I filled out and returned. They sent me from department to department, giving me the run around. No one was willing to make actual payment arrangements. They would contradict each department or service representative. They would tell me another company had purchased my loan and I had to speak to them to make arrangements. In the fall of 2011, Sallie Mae began to garnish my social security disability benefits even though they claimed to not own my loan and was unable to make any payment arrangements. In August 2011 the company that claimed to be the holder of my Sallie Mae loan said that I'd have to file for a discharge before they could make any type of loan consolidations or payment arrangements. They sent me the paperwork which I had my physician fill out and I returned it to them. I heard nothing from anyone for months. When I finally called in November, they said too much time had passed from when I had sent the paperwork in and I needed to resubmit it. I sent the paperwork again not just to the holding company, but to Sallie Mae because they are the company listed on the garnishment from the US Treasury Dept. Sallie Mae responded by saying my physician didn't fill out or sign the papers and to have them filled out by the physician. The papers had been filled out by the physician and signed by her. I sent a copy back to them. They sent a letter stating the same thing and that the physician ID # didn't match. When I called Sallie Mae, they gave me the run around stating they didn't own my loan and when I said they are garnishing my income they had no explanation. I sent the papers again to both companies and again the same letter was sent to me. I know the ID is fine and the papers are filled out correctly because Great Lakes Higher Education processed the same papers on my other student loan without any trouble and in fact, granted the discharge.It is now March 2012 and Sallie Mae continues to garnish my wages and continues to send the same exact letter no matter how many times I submit the papers. I've even had the physician fill out new paperwork so that they couldn't say they had expired. They still refuse to process the papers. It is my belief that Sallie Mae and any company acting with them or for them doesn't want to process my papers correctly because a discharge would mean no money for them. Business practices like this should not be allowed. If Sallie Mae doesn't own my loan, they shouldn't be able to take money from me and they should have to return every penny they have collected. Regardless of who owns the loan the papers should be processed and not returned each time with the same letter? Sallie Mae and the companies who are involved in this fraud should be held accountable and prosecuted."

After several more calls, and answers, I finally found out (through a US Senators office) how many loans he had out. It was then I noticed the double billings, one bill sent to him, one bill sent to me and another to his mother. It turns out we had been paying double on two loans and nothing on others.I tried sending a payment in without a statement and they credited to the wrong loan. In spite of repeated attempts to get some kind of monthly statement for the loans I have cosigned for, they refuse. I get one story from one person and another from someone else. They have shredded my credit in the process. The problem isn't that I'm trying to get out of what I cosigned for, it's that I can not get a bill mailed to me.

2012-02-28 19:50:44,"Manassas, VA",David,1.0,"Last year, I paid $3000 (my federal tax return) towards my higher interest loan, Loan 4. Sallie Mae then adjusted my payments such that less of my monthly $361.50 payment went towards the principal of Loan 4 (effectively, I'm now paying my lower interest loans off faster). Consequently, very little of my $361.50 monthly payment goes towards the principal of Loan 4 now (actually of the $53 that goes towards Loan 4 now, $32ish is interest alone). Of course, I contacted Sallie Mae to request that the distribution of my payments revert back to the way they were before I made my $3000 payment. I spoke to at least 3 Sallie Mae reps via phone and another 3 via email, only one of them understood what I was saying. That one representative who finally seemed to understand my complaint said he'd take care of it, then ultimately failed to correct the issue.Okay, so what if I'm paying my low interest loans off at a faster rate vs my high interest loan? Well let's extrapolate this information to all of Sallie Mae's customers (which I did in Excel). My assumptions: Total number of Sallie Mae Customers: 20,000,000, percentage of customers with multiple loans through Sallie Mae: 50%, percentage of those customers with loans of varying interest rates: 75%, percentage of those customers that make at least one additional payment towards their higher interest rate loans: 50%, amount of excess interest Sallie Mae earns on adjusting payments of customers who made at least one additional payment towards a higher interest rate loan: $125.00 over the life of the loans (let's assume 10 years, which mine is). Multiply all of that out for a grand total of $468,750,000.00 in additional income every 10 years by adjusting payments so that lower interest loans take priority over higher interest loans after an extra payment is made towards higher interest loans. Anyone want to write an article on this?Moral of the story: Don't pay off the higher interest loans any faster unless you're able to pay off the entire loan at once (or someone needs to sue Sallie Mae so that they learn not to steal money from their customers)."

I called customer service and got someone in India. They told me since Sallie Mae did not send out payment coupons, make 3 payments right away and you won't be charged late fees, which I did. Of course, now I'm being charged. The payment coupons say $71.43. And I finally got internet access and a temporary password from Sallie Mae a couple of weeks ago, since Sallie Mae locked me out of their website back in 2010 after I could not remember the address where I was staying when I got the loan. Online, the payment due is $90.00 and I have been paying $80.00 with the coupon that says $71.43. So Sallie Mae has been taking the overpayment and applying it to late fees that I did not even know about and they have been charging them since 2010."

I was. It took several calls and requests to keep speaking to supervisors, but they finally relented. This year they claim I am still ineligible, but according to their policy, the tax return can be 3 years old, meaning the one from last year is still applicable. Again, several calls, different information on every call and they finally put me back on IBR without notifying me. I just found out today when I called to check the status. The dates were wrong and the payments were too high, so I questioned them (politely, remember, these people aren't the ones in charge), until they could provide me with an answer that made sense. And yes, it was their error.I would encourage anyone having issues with Sallie Mae to keep calling and keep questioning when something doesn't make sense. Yes, it's time consuming, but I assume they hope that we just give up and get sick of fighting them to comply with their own ** policies. I know this may not help with the tax liens.I also recommend using this tactic with any big corporation you are dealing with. If something doesn't add up, it's probably wrong (and 99% of the time in their favor). Stay polite but consistent and firm that you are entitled to a full explanation.

A few moths later I received a letter from Sallie Mae stating that I owe them $11,199 and that I have not made one payment to them. I wrote letter after letter stating that they got all of my tax return, so why wont they accept that as a payment? I get another letter from them stating that I have never made a payment to them, which is a lie. I got the letter from the IRS stating they did. So I went to the BBB and made a complaint against them. They finally called me back and I received a letter from Sallie Mae stating they would not take my taxes anymore because they are going to look into it which is a lie. This year I filed my taxes. I was supposed to get $2,019. Well, that did not happen. I got another letter from the IRS stating that all $2,019 will be going to Sallie Mae. So they got a total of $7,080. I want to know why they can keep taking my money and then turn around stating they have never received a payment. Why do they have the right to keep sending me a bill when they got their money? This is not right! Either someone is a thief and taking the money for themselves or they are trying to rip me off.

We were not co-signers on his student loan. Premier has been calling our home for approx. a year and bickering at us about our son's deferments on his student loan. We explained to these people that he does not live here and has his own cell phone. We asked that our number be removed from their call list as we are disabled and have anxiety issues over the harassment. That request was denied. We have been getting calls from Premier (317-322-3621) on a daily basis. That includes a hang-up when we answered the phone. The calls start at 8am and continued until 8-9 pm during week days. My husband has MS and has fallen twice trying to answer the phone at 8am. We get scared at that time of the morning thinking that one of our grandchildren is sick or hurt. Everyone we know is aware not to call us in the mornings as we have a routine to adhere to due to our disabilities. Premier is well aware of these facts. Please, someone, make them stop. Our attorney is also our friend and at our disposal. I thought I would take the more Christian route and send a complaint out first. Thank you so very much for your attention to this matter.

2012-02-16 06:30:58,"San Jose, CA",Say,1.0,"In April, 2009, Sallie Mae didn't credit my payment. All my payment was automatically set to send out by my bank and was never late. I called them to fix the problem and also sent out a dispute claim. They sent me a letter saying that they found nothing wrong and will not fix the problem. They sent my defaulted loan to the credit bureau and collection department which is also just another part of Sallie Mae. I decided to stop paying until we get this resolved.Now they are taking my federal income tax so I called them again about the problem. They gave me the run around between Sallie Mae, USAfunds collection and Advocate Unit of Sallie Mae. They are saying now that my payment was credited back, but it is being credited into May 2009 instead of April 2009, which means that I am still missing the April, 2009 payment. They are also saying that my account didn't default until December 2009 that same year. I find it hard to believe because between April and December is 9 months long. If they didn't default my account and sent to collection until December, 2009, then why did the payment record from the collection department showed no payments starting from April?This is what I believe happened. Sallie Mae didn't credit my payment for April. They ignored my dispute and sent my account into default and collection. Once they realized that something was wrong, they deposited the payment into the account the following month to try and cover up the mistake. But the defaulted account and information were already sent out.Since loans from Sallie Mae is guaranteed and the government doesn't care what they do, they will get money no matter what. No one at Sallie Mae want to admit that Sallie Mae made a mistake on my payment and take responsibility for it. They even hang up the phone when they don't want to answer me because it's easier to just hang up and still get paid. At this point, my credit is ruined, my federal income tax stolen, and no one from Sallie Mae is admitting mistake or taking responsibility."
2012-02-16 04:59:40,"Faribault, MN",Liz,1.0,"Sallie Mae acquired one of my loans from Great Lakes at some point (heaven forbid the notify an account holder) in the past year or two. I took a 6-month unemployment deferment in March 2011, filed through Great Lakes. I was assured it covered all my loans, had I known SM had one, I would have confirmed with them as well. Other than receiving the approval letter, no type of communication: mail, email or by phone, was initiated until September 2011, when my deferment was up. I received a call from a SM rep (didn't think anything of it then), asking if I wanted to set up a payment plan. I requested another unemployment deferment, which was approved, and covered all loans from SM and GL.The request form for both the 1st and 2nd deferments are identical both originating from GL, same account # and personal information. Clearly covering all my loans. I applied for a private student loan in Nov. 2011 for professional school. The denial of that loan was the first I heard of the issues with my loans, including SM reporting 9 separate accounts as over 90 days past due. I called, and the representative repeated the same useless information, clearly from a script. I submitted my appeal, waited and called back a couple weeks later. The rep that time acknowledged the receipt of my documents, and to relax and give them time to review them. They still, two months later, have done nothing. Oddly enough, this is similar to what banks are doing to their mortgage-holding customers.Until this is resolved, I cannot complete my professional training, leaving me unable to pay of my student debt.

I fell into their trap and they got me by the you know what. So I decided to file bankruptcy. Little did I know that you are not allowed to file bankruptcy on your student loans. That is the trick! Sallie Mae gets rich because of that simple fact! This needs to end! Please go to ** and sign the petition to reinstate bankruptcy to student loans.

My loan is now 30% higher than the amount that I originally borrowed. Eventually, it will be double. When I borrowed the loan, I was not even told that I would not be able to obtain a deferment, if I needed one. I was also not told that I would be charged to go on a forbearance. Also, I was not told that if I miss three payments, my loan would default automatically, and if it defaults, they will add an additional 25% of the loan on top of the entire balance.I ran into financial difficulty, and had trouble making payments. They called me from several different numbers all day long. This is a conflict of interest, because they own the collection agencies that they use.  Something has to be done about these private student loans. How do they expect me to pay off the total of what I borrowed, plus 30%? I know many people are suffering, due to the unethical practices of Sallie Mae. No one needs to contact me about this.

2012-02-10 15:37:24,"Medford , NY",Joan,1.0,"One day, Sallie Mae had contacted me to update my personal information on the account with them. I did not think this was strange at all. They were my loan company. Regardless of how unfair they are, they have my credit in their hands, so I just pay my bill and deal with life. But this particular man was a bit strange when he was speaking to me. He asked if my address was the same and then a cell phone number and a house number. I had this whole conversation in my car parked in my driveway before I walked into the house because it was just the time the phone call caught me at. After I hung up the phone, I had just enough time to do inside and put my belongings down and received a text message. The text message read ""Thanks for the smiles. "" It was the man I was just speaking with. I was sure of it. I texted back and asked, ""Who is this?"" The man replied, ""Oh you dont' remember me? We were just speaking! "" He included a picture of himself, fully dressed, thank goodness! How creepy and unprofessional. I was completely uncomfortable with this company now having all my personal information, especially with this name being the person I just trusted to give my information to. My next payment, I was late, and when I tried to log in to my account online, it said my request was not authorized. I called Sallie Mae and asked why this was and they told me I was late on a payment so my privilege for seeing my account was taken away but I can give them a credit card over the phone. I asked to speak with a supervisor. I told the supervisor about my encounter with his employee and he had nothing to say. I then explained how I am not giving my credit card information over the phone as a security measure for myself and I would appreciate if I would have my ""privilege"" back of being able to log on and see my accounting and pay that way. His response was, ""Well, even if you put your information on the computer, my employees still has access to it."" Oh! How lovely, was he just pretty much telling me, ""oh well, my employees will do what they want?"" The fact you are not allowed online to pay your bill if you're past due is completely ridiculous. Do they want their money or not? They are complete morons over there at Sallie Mae!"
2012-02-09 22:39:46,"Milford, NJ",Jacob,1.0,"I took out a loan with Sallie Mae for the 2010-2011 school year. (My first year in college at Rutgers) Things didn't go so well and I was forced to take a medial leave of absence due to anxiety. Because I was no longer a full time student, my $25 payments were raised to $238 a month starting in November 2011. It's now February and I still have not been able to find a job to help my mother make the payments. When I called an agent to see what could be done, I was stonewalled. The only advice I was given was to default on the loan. Yes, the agent informed me confidentially as she said she could lose her job, that my best bet would be to default on my payments so I could apply for some sort of hardship deferment.At this rate I don't know how I'm going to be able to return to college or ever pay off this loan. Between the $238 monthly payments and the 10.75% interest rate, I'm completely stuck. Apparently, my payments will go back down to $25 once I become a full time student but I know for sure that I don't want to take out another loan with Sallie Mae. Even before I took the medical leave from school, I wasn't shown any respect from their employees. If a payment was just one day late, I would receive harassing phone calls from employees asking where the payment was. Any communication I attempt with them through email has been completely ignored. The only reply I ever received through email was when I contacted them regarding a payment they had taken out of the wrong account. I specifically made a payment using my savings account and they instead took the money from my checking, causing my account to be overdrawn and hit with a $25 fee. Their response was that, according to their records, there was no mistake and essentially ""it's not our problem."" I'm completely disgusted with this company and regret ever taking out this loan through them."

Our original papers stated that our interest would be between 0 and 5% and was fine the first few month. But by December, the amount went from $45.00 (I was sending in $200.00 a month to get it down fast for her) to now paying $178.00 a month with a 20 % interest rate! I have excellent credit and could not understand this. I called to be told that all first years get this rate and the it goes down. This is a Parents Plus Loan. And I also noticed that every time they do a distribution to the school, they add on $500.00 for that benefit! We are now with Citizens Bank (much better) but by the time she graduates, I will have paid in excess of $9,0000.00 in interest to be told that it does not go any where since when she graduates and goes into repayment the interest rate is adjusted and she starts accumulating interest Ll over again! I could have gone to a loan shark for a better deal. I have written emails to the President and have not even gotten a response! Something must be done!"

They put all the payments on one account making it appear I am defaulting on the loan. I have written them, talked to them, explained to them, etc. I am done.No more talking to them. They want me to go to their website and fix it. I don't think so. They are getting payments and quite a hefty interest rate. They made the mistake and they need to fix it. It's that simple.

2012-02-05 18:09:33,"Longmont, CO",Kelly,1.0,"I have been making payments in recent months toward the principal balance of my student loans, which were recently taken over by Sallie Mae. Instead of these payments being applied to the principal, as I indicated they should be, Sallie Mae has been applying them as early monthly payments, spreading the amount over three or four months usually. I am making these payments so I can whittle down my principal balance and reduce the amount of interest I'll pay in the long run. But by spreading them across my monthly payments instead and keeping my principal balance higher for longer, Sallie Mae is making more interest off my loans. I contacted Sallie Mae, and they said there was nothing they could do. That was how they applied payments. This seems wrong on so many levels, but what can I do? They are already making tens of thousands off of my interest. How is someone supposed to make progress on their debt if they can't make payments on the principal?"

I try to get the loan out of her name into my name and I also try to put it with my other consolidation. But Sallie Mae told me that I could not do either because it's a private loan. Sallie Mae also told me that the only way I can get the loan into my name is by going to a bank to take out the loan with them, and then take the money that I receive from the bank and pay them off. So, my question is, why do a person have to go through all those changes when Sallie Mae should have the means to allow a person to have their loan put in their name? Also, today I took a look on my Sallie Mae loan account and noticed that they add a $25 late fee to my loan on top of interest.  I have not been late on my bill in a long time and when I can remember being late, they never add a late fee to my bill. They just add the past months bill and the next months bill together including the interest rate.  To add on top of everything when I defer my loans, Sallie Mae increases my interest rate from 5% to 10%. This is almost 11% interest rate on the $7,000 student loan that I received in 2002, in which the final amount came up to $ 14,000 when I was able to start paying on it in 2009.  Now, I have the loan down to little over $10,000 and they slap this new $25 late fee. I feel that this loan will never get paid off because Sallie Mae keeps adding new hidden fees.  So, if possible, can someone please help?  I need the loan taken out of my grandmother's name and also need a lower interest rate."

I was told I had to resubmit all papers again, which I did in Nov. 2011.  Now I come to find out this morning that they stole my tax money of 7909 and some cent.  When I called this morning, I was told that there were no papers on file and that I would have to resubmit all papers again.

So I did everything they told me to do; more checks over the phone and reset up the auto withdrawal. Next month, same thing, they didn't take the money. I get calls and late payments. I did this every month until December. In January, they took two payments and said I had made a phone in payment which I had not done so. I have engaged in more fighting with Sallie just to get my money back. The representative said I could have my money in 24 hours, another lie. I called them again and got a completely different story. I told them I was recording the conversation they then got upset and told that is not allowed. So they can record ours phone conversations but we cant? Sallie Mae needs to be investigated soon. If anyone hears of an investigation I would love to help."
2012-01-31 18:52:33,"Pittsburgh, PA",Katherine,1.0,"By the end of 2006, I decided to attend school at the Art Institute of Philadelphia. Being from a single parent home, that was torn by divorce, there was no extra funds to send me to school. When I began enrolling, I applied for my FAFSA, and all federal loans, and also needed to apply for a private loan. Art Institute directed me to Sallie Mae. I could not be approved by myself, so my mother cosigned for the loan with me. I began school full time. Every 3-6 months, I had to reapply for a loan since our credit wasn't that great to begin with. We were not able to apply for the full, or half of the amount of my tuition. After the first two times my mother's credit was no longer able to support me as a co-signer. and I was forced to ask my father, a man whom hasn't bothered to be a part of our lives, since before I was in middle school. This is the man I'm asking to cosign and help put me through college. Surprisingly, he agrees to help and co-signs for me. By 2007, I was attending the Art Institute in LA, and was living on my with my boyfriend, who I met at school. By the time the loan, my father co-signed for, ran out, I was 2 years into a 3 year bachelor's degree program. When I went to apply for a loan, to at least get within six months of having my bachelor's degree, I of course was turned down, and at this point, even my father's credit was not enough. Too many loan applications in a short span of time will do that, you know. In short, I was forced to drop out of college, because we could no longer afford to put me through school. 6 months later, I have a measly part-time retail job, and Sallie Mae starts their rounds. They wanted to start with something like $900 a month, which was thrice what I was paying for my housing, by then. I tried making smaller payments, until one day, I was laid off. I called them, and asked them for a deferment, which would cost $100, which I didn't have, at that time. So my payments became late, until my boyfriend could loan me $100 to put me on deferment for hardship. Without my degree, I've bounced around from ** retail job to ** retail job, when I'm lucky enough to find one. The better part of the last 3 years have been spent broke and unemployed. Sallie Mae does not cares. They just began calling my father relentlessly, which I suppose I should thank them for, because my father is only interested in how my life is going, when he is making a call about Sallie Mae. His hand was forced to make a payment, when I could not, to save his own credit. Meanwhile, Sallie Mae runs my credit once every month, to make sure I cannot move up ,unless I ""pay the man"" with money I don't have. I am pretty much their servant for life, for wanting to go to school, and make a better life for me, than my mother could. That's awesome."

First, I have received billing statements from Sallie Mae for another person at my current address. It took nearly 6 months and 4 or 5 telephone calls to finally get that person who hasn't lived here removed--for at least 6 years, if ever. Secondly, I tried to get my address corrected by substituting an N for an M on the street address. That took 4 telephone calls, a UPS stamp of my correct address and to rid myself of the wrongful tenant above on Sallie Mae correspondence. It seems as if loans have been in hibernation and after 2 years of dormancy they appear as a subsidized loan that I have no affirmation of their validity. Now, I have to go online to retrieve interest paid tax docs from Sallie Mae. Why don't they send them out? Is that another way they can milk the public out of a tax deduction?"

At the time, the company I had worked at for over six years ceased operations leaving me unemployed.  I wanted to get a totally deferred loan for my son but Sallie Mae told me they didn't offer one.I continued with Sallie Mae for the 2010 school year but told them again that I wanted a totally deferred interest loan given that I remained unemployed for almost two years.  I started working part-time at the end of 2010 and do so until this day, however, my income has dropped from roughly 65K per year to 42K and it is difficult to make the accruing interest payments on this loan.I left Sallie Mae for Wells Fargo this year when I learned that they had a totally deferred interest loan.  Sallie Mae has tried to get me back as a customer since they now offer the same type loan.  Here are my questions:  Shouldn't Sallie Mae have given me some type of break in the process, given the extent of my unemployment and couldn't they have offered me a totally deferred interest loan in the beginning of this process?  It has become difficult for me to meet the monthly payment on the two school year loans I took out with Sallie Mae so I wanted to work out a reduced payment plan.  One loan officer there said that it would be no problem but never sent the documentation they said I would need to fill out so I could be given a $25 per month break on this payment.  Why would they tell me that and not follow through.When I called Sallie Mae back, they stated the other person was wrong to have told me that they could work with me to reduce the payment.  Why do they not work together and know their own rules?  What recourse do I have with them now because at my reduced income and the accrual of interest across two loans now it is crippling us financially.  I can't continue much longer at this rate."

Anyway, I took out loans from Sallie Mae, and I thought I had six months to pay them back without interest being due, so I was able to get the amount of money borrowed, to pay them off completely. Anyway, they decide that this is not good enough, so they say that we still owe them $89, which my husband refuses to pay. Yeah, I should have paid them the $89.  Along comes 2008. I have very little income. They garnish $159 dollars in wages. You think that they are done. They got almost double the $89, count the thing as written off. Meanwhile, I don't hear from these people until 2010, when they decide to garnish my husband's wages, somewhere to the tune of $2,000.00.Then comes my mistake. I looked up my account, and found out that I owe them about $450. We send them a money order for that amount, thinking it will settle the loan. I called them up a month later, and we still owe them $450 dollars. You would think that if the principal is $40, the thing would be paid off, you pay them $450, but no, the interest comes first, then their stupid collection fees, and then the principal, so you find out. I will not pay this company any more money. Not that I feel like I should have any reason to worry. My credit sucks, because it went into default, which I don't think is a big deal, because I really don't agree to the whole idea of loans anymore. Sure, I may bounce from home to home in life, will never have a car, but at least I will never have another debt, because I'm sure that these greedy people have ruined my credit, and can never get another loan!"

I have called three times this morning, January 23, 2012, to get a payoff amount. I have been told 2 different amounts in a matter of 20 minutes on the same day.

Each time I make a payment, though, within approximately 3 weeks I get a notice from SM that I owe a huge amount extra and that this payment will keep me from going into default. I have paid over $10,000 to them above and beyond the monthly payments, and then three weeks ago they asked for another $7,000. I wasn't going to pay this without explanation. They put my account into default and when I went today to pay my monthly amount, the system wouldn't allow me to do this."
2012-01-19 15:50:08,"Waterport, NY",Siraj,1.0,"Sallie Mae interfering with Federally backed repayment options:I currently have a number of federal student loans that are being serviced by Sallie Mae. I recently spoke to an agent to discuss options to reduce my monthly payments. At no point in time did the agent offer the federal income based repayment plan and it only came into the conversation after I mentioned it specifically. All of my loans are eligible to receive consideration under this program. The Sallie Mae representatives gave me information that conflicted with information provided by the U.S. Department of Education, and they failed to be transparent about other details of the program (i.e. formula for calculating monthly payments, which is available from the U.S. Dept of Ed). For example the agent explained that there was no such forgiveness of payments in the Sallie Mae version of the income based payment option, which is a huge feature of the feature of the federal program that offers forgiveness after 25 years of making all qualifying payments. Either Sallie Mae is failing to inform its representatives of the full details of the programs it offers, or it is signing people up to income based repayment options that are not associated with the federal program and thereby failing to offer the federally backed option to student borrowers. I think this should be investigated as all borrowers are entitled to enjoy the benefits of programs designed by the federal government. Private loan servicers should in no way be allowed to interfere with federal programs and withhold valuable information. I will contact the Department of Education directly in order to mediate because the failure of Sallie Mae to be transparent worries me that they will not honor the terms of the specific program. I believe practices like this should be investigated."
2012-01-19 03:32:22,"Topeka, KS",David,2.0,"Sallie Mae has been harassing me with phone calls for the past several months. They said that my student loans have been delinquent for over 20 days. In a 30-minute period of time, both my parents and myself were called about the exact same loan. I deferred my loans because I am currently working on my master's degree from a credited college. I told them that I was back in school and I expect to graduate in 2013. The Clearing House has acknowledged that I am back in school full-time. Although I have been back in school since fall, they still continue to call me and harass me. How inconsiderate!"
2012-01-17 19:51:23,"Oslo, Other",Shelli,3.0,"I have been trying to pay my loans with Sallie Mae for over a week. The reason for the word 'trying' is that they deleted the telephone numbers from their website. As I live overseas, the only way I can pay my monthly payment is via the telephone using my debit card from my Norwegian bank. Naturally, I rely on the telephone numbers listed on the website and when they disappeared for five days, it causes irritation. I already have to pay expensive fees to make the payment over the phone. In addition, I pay for the long distance phone call as their ""International Number"" is not toll free. The frustration of wading through their automated system is getting unbearable especially when I can't even use the automated system to make a payment via telephone without the system rejecting my zip code. (I have a 4 digit zip and they require an American zip). I just wish that customer service was a priority and by that I mean human customer service which does not rely upon a computer script but that actually listens to the human customer."

I tried for several hours on-line six months ago. After finding many online paths that would lead me to defaulting or lowering my monthly payment but none to increase I called them on the phone. I spent at least a half an hour waiting. Finally, I spoke with a person and explained my situation. I simply wanted to double my monthly payment. They said it was fine and we confirmed the process. I hung up slightly annoyed but confident the situation had been handled. Because most of the emails I get from them are spam, trying to sell me credit, etc., I haven't been on their site since. Today, while looking at a tax form they sent me, I found they had never upped my monthly payment. Therefore, I have been paying off essentially only interest for six months and the amount I owe has only grown. There is no way for me to rectify this situation on-line even though there are fast and easy ways to lower my payment on-line. This practice sounds highly unethical to me. Thank you for your time."

I already have a small Sallie Mae loan with automatic payment from my bank. However, I never agreed to paying this other loan the same way. While they didn't just take the money from my account, they also did not send me any billing statements or payment books (not even through email). Basically, 3 months passed, and Sallie Mae contacted me about being over 90 days delinquent on paying my student loan. I was livid, because I have great credit. It was completely irresponsible of them to never send me a notice or letter with payment options. One would assume that if you always got a statement in in the mail when the loan was with Citibank, that practice would continue when it is ""bought"" by another bank. I asked the person from Sallie Mae to send a payment book. What did I get in the mail? Nothing! I just called to see when my payment is due. It's due in less than a week, yet I've received nothing in the mail. I'm totally disgusted."

After going though my research for my upcoming Tax Court appearance, I have discovered Sallie Mae's aggressive collection techniques may have violated federal law and also fraudulently reported a 1099C three years after I settled the debt.I have also found on the IRS website under Instructions for Forms 1099-A and 1099-C - Main Contents- Multiple Debtors: For debts incurred before 1995 and for debts of less than $10,000 incurred after 1994, you must file Form 1099-C only for the primary (or first-named) debtor. In addition, through my research I discovered that the student loans were forgiven due to the Chapter 7 case # 04-08579 filed by the school on October 1, 2004.This has caused an ongoing IRS dispute since 2008 resulting to a Tax Court hearing January 30, 2012. I have incurred court fees, mailing fees, fax fees, and countless time to research and compile information to prove my case. This resulted in uncovering the fraudulent reporting of Sallie Maes 1099C to reduce their tax liabilities as well as possible violations for collecting on a debt that was already settled or forgiven due to a Chapter 7 filed by the school."

They do not care about you or anything except harassing you to give them money. They call me up to 5 times a day, telling me that my credit is being affected. Well, no! I owe them $40,000. Since the constant harassment for over 3 years and the depression that follows the ever lingering debt by this horrible company that refuses to help me out, I have decided that I would rather die than to give them a penny of my money. Sure, my credit score will be affected. Sure, Ill never be able to take out another loan, but I'm pretty sure I was ** since the moment I signed those papers. I have done so much research, and to hear and read these horrible stories about how people get so far to paying it off, or think they pay it off and Sallie Mae grips their talons even harder and slaps them with a phony fee of some sort. This company is a life-ruiner, and I will not pay them. After the stuff they have said to me on the phone, I believe throwing my money into the wind is more beneficial than paying them. Take a loss of $40,000 Sallie Mae, you aren't getting a dime. I wish someone would file a class action lawsuit on these people for harassment."

2012-01-10 22:19:28,"Great Bend, NY",Emily,2.0,"I woke up to a phone call from a collections agency that said my private student loan was a year overdue and delinquent. I was threatened with a lawsuit and told that ""these things can't be ignored"". I wasn't ignoring them, I hadn't heard from them in a long time. I explained my situation: in 2010, I had a psychotic episode while attending graduate school in Texas. I was first diagnosed as being Bi-polar with Psychotic systems and I was put on heavy medication that made me a zombie. When I went home for winter break, my mother was so alarmed that she decided I needed to see a psychiatrist. We finally found one and learned that I wasn't on the right medication. Six months went by. I was diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder, a form of Schizophrenia. I was unable to work, seeing a psychiatrist and a counselor, plus attending support group meetings at a local organization for people with disabilities. I tried returning to my old job, but I just couldn't function. So after about a month, I quit. I was able to collect SSI once a month for about $480.When I talked to the man from the Collections agency, he reduced my payment but it was still beyond my means. I asked about a payment plan and he said there wasn't one available. If I didn't resolve the issue, they would present a lawsuit against me. Then he miraculously gave me a payment plan where I would pay down $2,300 and $200 a month. I can barely afford the $200, let alone manage to collect $2,300. My parents couldn't help. Their credit is shot. My mom was laid off from her job and having trouble collecting unemployment. My dad and sister were the only ones working up until recently when my mom was called back to work. They gave me until the 27th to have the money and set up an auto payment plan which I'm not very crazy about. I barely get any money as is and I owe for Federal Loans and for loans from Discover Student Loans. It is unrealistic for me to be able to pay back any of these at this point in my life.The customer service was awful. I was treated like I was stupid. The man had no compassion whatsoever, and he ridiculed me for ignoring my responsibility to pay. I guess they'll just have to file a lawsuit against me. I really don't have the money, neither do my parents, and there is no one I can borrow from. They wouldn't gain much because I barely have any money, and I have no assets. I'm filled with concern over the whole thing. I am scared to call them back because they were rather hostile. I wish I had never taken a loan out with Sallie Mae. I'm learning that they are a crooked organization that mistreats people and lacks compassion."

The school I went to turned out to be a joke and I could not get a job afterwards. Therefore, I could not pay Sallie Mae what they demanded and I did not have a means to begin paying until early 2006, at which point the loan went from $21,000 dollars to $31,000 because of all their interest and fees. I could never afford the monthly payment they wanted and I begged them several times to lower it. They always flatly refused and in fact went ahead and raised the payment yearly. Their due date has always been in the beginning of the month.Ive called over and over to have the due date changed as I couldnt pay in the beginning of the month due to my rent being due, but they flatly refuse so that they can continue to collect their late fees. I have recently lost my job and am expecting my very last paycheck in a few weeks. Last year I had $10,000 worth of unexpected expenses in my family and I had a baby. When I was initially behind 6 months ago, I called and tried to work something out with them, and they said that they could give me forbearance if I paid the two months I was already behind. If I had a way to do that, I wouldnt have been behind in the first place! They told me to find someone to borrow money from. As time went on I tried to make a payment here and there, but I can't catch up. Now I have my last paycheck looming and they say I owe $1500. I called again and tried to work something out. They told me because of how many days the loan was late, they couldn't help me with the loan. It is always a new excuse with them. Then they transferred me to collections and they told me even though my income is now negative, I qualify for no programs. They told me to pay for 3 months and then 3 months from now call for a forbearance. That would make the balance owed just as high, and during forbearance they charge outrageous interest. So at the end of it, you end up owing them more and are in more of a mess. Then they told me to make half a payment now to buy me some time, but in 3 weeks I'll be in the same boat. I am tired of being preyed on by this company. I want to pay my loan if they would just work with me, but they refuse to work with you and bully you. The last time I made a payment with them, they asked if the number I was calling from was my phone. I said no, but they continuously call the number anyway. Please, is there anyone who can help me? My credit is continuously taking hits because of these people. I make payments but the loan never goes down. I cant have a car or a house because of Sallie Mae."
2012-01-06 17:27:22,"Houston, TX",Al,1.0,"Sallie Mae is purposefully delaying payments from posting in order to accumulate additional interest and force customers to incur late payment fees. If my grocery store on the corner is able to make an immediate withdrawal from my checking account at their register, surely Sallie Mae has the same capability for a payment transaction made on their website. If I make a payment today, it should post today! It is unconscionable. All those dollars made off all those delayed payments add up to a lot. Class action lawsuit anyone?"

The payment was sent to Sallie Mae for $4200. At that time I had paid off some of the loan and owed around $3700. At first the school said they sent the check, but nothing changed on my Sallie Mae account. I checked and checked, nothing. The school sent me a copy of the cashed check and who it went to in Sallie Mae. I called Sallie Mae's customer service and told them about the issuepretty much useless. One person even told me that they didnt have an office in Delaware where the check had been sent to (also Sallie Mae's head office).By doing some research on the internet, I found another Sallie Mae number (not listed on their website!) and was able to explain to someone my issue. 2 weeks later, an update was finally made to my account. However, even though I only owed $3700 and had paid over a year and a half of interest, and after the $4200 refund went thru, Sallie Mae said I still owed them $300! After calling the main customer support line, I was told by a ""manager"" that I didnt understand simple math, or how credit works and must pay them! Again, I reached out to the number not listed on their website, and someone easily saw that when the refund payment had been entered, they only entered 2/3rds of it! The customer service is laughable at best, and for a ""manager"" to try and make me feel stupid when I was just trying to explain my situationunreal. Do not get a school loan thru them."

Ever since then, Sallie Mae has been randomly applying small late fees to my account in the middle of a billing cycle. There is no proper bill provided and no explanation given.Whenever I contact Sallie Mae, they tell these payments are ""partial late fees"" from late fees applied from earlier billing periods. They provide no other explanation. I do not understand this, as I already paid late fees! They generally refuse to provide straight answers, and put more effort into obfuscation than transparency.Whenever I have spoken to them, they assure me that the small ""partial late fee"" is the last late fee I will pay. So I make a payment. After it posts, another late fee pops up, again without explanation or a bill, and I receive the same convoluted and misleading answers from ""customer"" service.Has anyway else had this experience? I refuse to make any more payments random late fees when my account has not had a late payment in over half a year (except of course my required monthly payments). So far, over a 3 month period, these random fees have totaled about $40. Not much, but over the life of the loan a big amount if it does not stop soon."

About a month ago, I received a letter from Sallie Mae stating that my monthly loan payment has now changed to $1032/month starting January 2012. I was completely shocked. I just graduated and got a job. I have two other federal loans plus other debt. I called Sallie Mae because they advertise that their plans are ""customizable to meet the needs of their customers and can be lowered or adjusted on income."" I was told that there was nothing that could be done for me. I explained to the customer rep that I can only afford the $568 that I had planned on paying for the next two years, that I want to be on time with my payments but would be impossible to do since they doubled by payments out of nowhere. This company provides no assistance or customer service. I feel that they want you to go into default so that they can charge late fees and ruin your credit. Here, I am telling them that I want to responsibly pay my debts off but am asking for lower payments (which they would profit from more in the long run besides!) or a longer loan period and the only answer I got was, ""There is nothing we can do for you.

I called twice over the next two weeks to ask if my application had been processed. Both times, I was told, ""Not yet."" I received a letter 16 days later threatening collection action, as my loans had not been paid. I called again and was told that I needed to apply for forbearance to avoid the collection, so I did. I called two weeks later to check on the application, and was told that a hold had been put on the application processing, since it was within a window of 45 days until the next loans would come due. I was told to call back in one week to request that those loans be included in the processing. I called back one week later and was told that my application had been denied because I had not filed taxes the previous year. I explained that I had not filed taxed due to insufficient income, and that I had been instructed by Sallie Mae to write a letter explaining this and include it with the application, which I had done. Then I was told that my application had been denied since I had not included proof of my income. I explained that I had been unemployed for several months at the time of completing the application, and that I had made that clear on my application. I have been told that my options are to start completely over with the application, or to call back in two weeks.The consequence is that my Income Based Repayment period is not starting due to stalling by Sallie Mae. My loans are coming due, and I am facing the threat of collection action each time since my forbearance period is now over. Furthermore, none of these events are communicated to me by Sallie Mae. I find out what they are doing with my application only when I make calls. I am needing to make calls every one to two weeks, and each call lasts at least thirty minutes.

Two months later, in December, I received a late payment notice, and a $42 fee from them, because I failed to pay November's payment. I contacted Sallie Mae again, and told them the situation. I spoke with Randall this time, who advised me he would waive the late fee, and to make my payment online on December 28. I did so on December 28, as I was told (again), and I find that the Sallie Mae website won't process it for two days, which means another late fee. This is just one example of many times I have been misinformed by Sallie Mae representatives, where I have to pay the price. I believe their business tactics are crooked, to say the least, and their staff is poorly trained and clueless. I cannot wait until this loan is paid off, and I will continue to tell everyone I know, ""do not get a ;pan via Sallie Mae!""  I have to pay another late fee, due to their misinformation."

I told the supervisor that this was not an option. After he continued to persist, I told him that I wanted to speak to someone else or that I would hang up the phone. He said that I wasn't going to speak to anyone else, so I hung up on him.This was simply another case of a bad person being employed by a bad company.

I have been paying on two Sallie Mae Excel Graduate loans since graduating in February.  I missed a payment in September and the phone calls started then.  One day, a person would call and I would explain that I was unemployed and they would be nice.  The next day, someone would call and rudely tell me to go work at McDonald's, rake leaves, etc.  I have told them repeatedly that I would make payments as I could; but seeing how they wouldn't allow me to go into forbearance until after I lost my job and missed a payment and then they wanted $150 to file that forbearance - there was nothing I could do. I made a partial payment in October, November, and now, yesterday.  They called me 2-4 times a week; one time being nice - next being rude.  The straw was this evening when Kimberly called me and informed me that they were not accepting my $50 payment due to it was not the $700 I was in arrears (they applied it to my accounts).  She informed me that I was going into default and they've been threatening this for two months and my credit score would go down.  Why is it that Sallie Mae will not work with me and yet the Federal loans are all in IBR and are within my means to pay?  I have asked Sallie Mae repeatedly to lower my payments or to work with me.  I have also now told them that being able to pay my house payment is more important than making the full $300 payment to them.

I have contacted the Dept. of Education since they paid off the loans in 2009 and expect the late pay to be removed but I would suggest everyone that has had a bad experience with Sallie Mae tell 10 of their friends and family members about their experience.

No one could tell me where the payment went. It took until November of 2011 to find out through our bank who traced the checks to find out that the money went to Great Lakes to pay another loan which my daughter had which was not due until she had finished a course of study at an on-line school. That money was not due and I had not co-signed for it. The account number for the co-signed loan was on both checks."
2011-12-04 18:40:38,"Deptford, NJ",Andrea,1.0,"I am not rating this experience because it has been less than worthy of even a half star rating. Let me further explain...I entered into college in August of 2005. My parents are a less than attractive candidates for co-signing or paying for my tuition, I had to find alternatives. I was eighteen, of course my credit was nonexistent. Anyways, I was led to Sallie Mae, who sounded as though they would take anyone. I had to obtain a co-signer for my first few loans and build personal credit on my own. The school I attended was rather pricey but the reputation was well worth the struggle. Besides, it was portrayed by every source that college would land me the better job and life I always wanted for myself and those around me. So I took out the loans.Now, graduated, I find that I must repay these loans six months after graduation, which I find unfair due to both the unemployment rate as well as our country's current economic status, but I digress. So May, I graduated and I landed a mediocre job in July. After settling down in the position and figuring out my income I decided to call Sallie Mae and find out what my payments would be come December. I spoke to a nice lady who informed of their payment structure. She explained that each loan I took out, totaling 6 (when I built my credit up, I started to take out loans per semester) would have a separate interest rate and those rates and loans would have their individual monthly payment and all those individual payments would be added for a total monthly payment. Now, I have a problem with this, but it gets much better. The total in mid-August was $865/month. It is now December. I called last month to put my loans into forbearance, because I am now at a part-time position and knew in August that $865 in addition to my federal loans was not manageable. They proceeded to tell me my loans are now $1,200/month (roughly). However, after putting them into forbearance, they informed me that my next payment is in three months, due to economic hardship. I paid $150 to put them into forbearance (which did not go towards my loans, it was more of a penalty to put them in that state) and my returning payment in March would be $2,000!I know I am the one who chose Sallie Mae, however I am just a middle-class student who had no way of going to school on anyone's dollar. Sure, I regret the fact that I did not choose community college then proceed to a university but still I stand by my decision of trying to better myself despite my family's less fortunate state. My parents do well to hold a roof over my head and even live comfortably, but despite that lifestyle, I wanted to be able to provide for my family like they did for me. Having nice Christmases despite any troubles that may arise (which there was always something with a car, house anything that became costly to my parents around the holidays) they still tried and gave us a nice holiday, but I wanted to try and strive for less struggle. I wanted to be able to provide even for my parents, not a new home or car, but maybe a vacation or new appliances as a thank you. Now I am thanking them with the probable lifestyle of having me as an expense in their home (which they are very understanding and can provide) for the next umpteen years.Sallie Mae has ruined any future I can have as a result of my degree, yet the only thing they can't take from me is the degree. With the unemployment and state of our economy my chance at any job is harsh, not enough experience, too much experience and the chance of living, just living would require $40,000 a year. Yeah, unfortunately for me, I also had to work during college to commute there.I guess my point is more or less, don't use them and if you're a parent, please do whatever you can to steer your children in the right direction where they can live after college. I am not saying pay for them, because I know it's hard, but research your options and their options before making a decision. I hear a lot of good things about Nelnet. My parents did all they could for me but being the oldest, they were desperate and I appreciate all they did to find me a way. I just am very disappointed that Sallie Mae took advantage and will continue to do so to me, my family and future students."
2011-12-03 03:08:32,"Tyler, TX",Np,1.0,"I was contacted from Sallie Mae saying that they were trying to contact me, so I said for what? They said because I owe them money. I said, ""No, I do not. I don't even have a loan with you."" They then said that they obtained my loan and that it was in repayment. I said how I am still in school full-time and have a 3.8 GPA. They then said I wasn't in the clearing house. I said. ""What clearing house? They said a database that indicates if students are in school full-time. I contacted my school, they informed me I was in the database, that it was Sallie Mae, that they would give the sealed forms to send them months later and my bill is still in repayment instead of in-school deferment. They constantly call me saying I owe all hours of day starting every hour on the hour. I want it to end and I want another loan company to take my loans. Help! No one in customer service will help get this loan in an in-school deferment. It's as if they want me to pay my loan and go to school. I haven't even graduated. Sorry for typos, etc. I am tired!"
2011-12-02 05:18:22,"Bloomfield Hills , MI",Michael,1.0,"Where do I even begin? I have a 3 years of college loans with SM and 1 semester of law school loans as well. My government loans are totaling roughly 51K and an additional 70K in private loans. Ultimately, when your undergraduate education costs $30k/year, this is what I have been faced with. I graduated in 2007 and quickly faced the realities of the economy in the fall of 2008. I have consolidated the government loans but they have informed me my private loans are not eligible for consolidation.For two years, I have paid $432/month without missing a single payment. For my law schools loans, I am making another payment of $348/month. Needless to say, it is very difficult to make payments of nearly $800/month. In October, I sent in my 1040 and Nelnet loans information to reapply for the income based repayment for 2011-2012. On October 14th, I received email confirmation that my form had been received and would be processed. This never happened and on November 24th, I began to receive phone calls that I was delinquent on my payments. This evening at 10:15 pm Eastern, I received a phone call informing me I was delinquent in my payments and they want $103 today. I had to inform them that I am still waiting for my income based repayment plan to update my monthly dues. She obviously had no clue of this. She offered me a solution of 1% interest only payments which would be $435 on my private loans. Then I would have to pay my government loans, which could be in the range of $250-$350/month plus the $348 I am paying to Nelnet.How does anyone expect to afford these payments unless they live rent/mortgage free? The woman's response to my situation was ""nobody forced you to take out these loans for education. At some point you need to hold your own responsibility."" She proceeded to tell me she doesn't have a college education and speaks very well. I suppose this is considered successful in today's society, debt free and can speak well. If I could go back 8 years I would obviously do things differently."

I was told that the loan was discharged and I also never received any letters or calls to indicate that there was a problem and I was in default. I spoke with Steve *** at the Default Resolution Group 800-xxx-xxxx and he told me that there was a company that was contracted with to handle the discharges and that that company was not performing correctly and they were let go. During that process, my paperwork was lost and my discharge was never completed. They do have all the calls documented. I just spoke with a supervisor, Roger ***, at the same number to try to get this problem fixed and he said there was nothing I could do to expedite the process and get my credit cleared. He did not even apologize that it was their fault all this happened and now I can't get a loan to fix my home. I understand that I now have to fill out the paperwork again but they should at least remove me from default status so I can get my home loan. An apology for causing me all this grief would be nice too. They've really messed things up. My home is in need of repairs and now I can't get a loan because of this."
2011-11-28 23:48:48,"Cordova, TN",Josh,1.0,"In 2007, I had began to make payments on my account via automatic draft. Due to the economy, I could only afford to pay the interest. I had gotten some bills paid over the years and wanted to raise the amount to which I had been paid to hit the principal so I started contacting Sallie Mae inquiring how to do this. Starting in the summer of 2010, I have talked to at least six reps and two supervisors telling me I would be able to do that over the phone. I put the request in and they apologized each time and said it would post on the next account. Each time my payment would post, nothing would happen. So I began emailing them through there website. I have shot them several emails for the past four months and have yet to even get a response. Well, my payment finally went up $30, even though I requested a different amount. It was at least something to push toward my loan. Well, two payments have gone through and nothing has been applied towards my principal loan balance.

On two separate occasions, I was told that it would be corrected by supervisors named Kerry and Brandon; it has not. My last call prior to filing this complaint was today at 4:50 PM.  I was told by a representative named Amanda that she would read through the notes on my account which required putting me on hold.  After waiting ten minutes, I re-dialed the number and discovered that the office had closed for the evening.

2011-11-18 16:22:40,"Tyler, TX",Wendy,1.0,"I curse the day Sallie Mae bought my Chase loans. I called today to have the amount auto-deducted from my account raised, so I could pay off my loan sooner. After trying every option pre-recorded, nothing suited me. So I pressed ""0000"" to get an operator. It then told me I would be charged $15 to pay over the phone. No. So I went back to the main menu, and started over. I finally was able to press ""0000000000"", to get an operator. Let me mention here, every time I was on hold, there was dead silence. I couldn't decide if my call had been dropped, or if I was still waiting.  Anyway, I finally got a live person.  Her first language was clearly not English.  She told me the new amount would show up on my next bill, but she also said something about it having to be approved.  I asked her, ""So does this have to go through an approval process, or will it just show up on my next bill? "" Her answer: ""yes"". I told her I had just asked two separate questions.  Again, she said ""yes"".  So I asked again, and she started reading a canned response, about the best was to contact me.  I called her on it and said she was just reading queues and not answering my questions. Silence. I asked to be transferred to someone who could better help me (a.k.a., knew English). I got another person, her supervisor, different nationality, but still, English was second language.  At first, I thought she knew what I was asking, but then I asked her about this ""approval"" to pay more.  Shouldn't they jump at this? She just kept repeating that she couldn't tell me the exact amount today over the phone. But ""I am telling you the exact amount!"" I wanted to scream. Alright, whatever. I dropped it. So then I asked if the extra I am paying will go to principal, and not interest. I didn't get a straight answer. I think she understands less than I do about loans. She said I have to pay interest first. I told her that if the money goes to principal, my interest will decrease, therefore, I don't want to pay more than I have to. She said I would pay it off sooner. Oh really? Is that what happens when you increase your monthly payments? She didn't get it.  I just gave up at that point. We will see what happens on my next bill. I want this applied to my principal! I was on the phone for about 20 minutes. With Chase, this would have taken me 2 minutes. I miss them. Sallie Mae sucks."
2011-11-16 14:24:25,"Rochester, MN",Kristi,1.0,"I received a ""welcome letter"" from Sallie Mae in late September stating that my Citibank loan would now be handled by Sallie Mae.

I was told it wouldn't be an issue, and that it would be transferred over and just to start with payments to Sallie Mae the following month. Well, life gets busy and time rolls around to when I would have paid Citibank when I realize, we have never gotten any additional correspondence from Sallie Mae like where to send a payment, due date, etc. I called them up, and sure enough, my account was now 5 days delinquent. It turned out that they sent the statement to an email address that I no longer use.I was told it was no big deal, since it had just transferred to them, and they allow 90 days for such incidence before reporting them. I was also told that I could go online to make a payment or mail it to them, and then I could also set up auto payments with them online. I chose to make an online payment. It processed, but then when I tried to set up auto pay, it told me my account was still delinquent. I thought, ""Ok, I need to give it a couple hours.""Again, life is busy, and I forgot about it until two days later. I went back to set it up, and it was still showing as delinquent. I check my bank account, and the money was withdrawn the day before. So I called Sallie Mae again. I was told, ""it can take up to a week after a payment is processed to post to the account."" I can understand that if I mailed a check to them. But I processed it online. It really takes a week to link them up from an online payment?

2011-11-15 13:58:05,"Greenville, MI",Tara,1.0,"I took out my first Sallie Mae (SM) loan around 2005/ 2006. I believe I have 4 loans total with SM (all of which are private). When I first took out a loan with Sallie Mae, I asked if I would be able to consolidate my SM loans with my federal loans. SM's reply was yes. When I eventually consolidated my loans, SM would not release my loans. I now have three different lenders as I continued my education after consolidation.I have since completed my M.S. degree and was told that I lost my grace period. My first payment was due 2 weeks after I completed my program. This is beyond ridiculous. Every time I call Sallie Mae, I am told something completely different than what the first person told me. I called in October to apply for an economic hardship. However, I was told this service did not apply to private loans. I then asked about forbearance because I had one loan that was past due according to their records, two in deferment, and one in a grace period. The first person told me that I could apply for forbearance. He then gave me contradictory information about applying for forbearance. So, I asked to talk to a supervisor. I had to talk to two supervisors who told me that I didnt qualify for forbearance. I have over $40K in SM loans, I work part-time, and I am a single mother. I then called back, spoke to someone else, and qualified for forbearance. When I called back a few weeks later after receiving a bill for over $800 for past due loans, I was told that all my loans were past due. I called another time, and was told completely different than what I just reported. Why cant SM get their act straight? I cannot afford to pay back my loans right now, let alone pay for SMs monetary mistakes. As I read everyone else posts, I can see that I am not the only who has issues. I also never received notice that I could not consolidate my SM loans with my federal. Something needs to be done about this. It is apparent SM has major issues with service, professionalism, and everything else. I also stated, ""I guess I have to make a choice between feeding my family and paying back my loans?

This year, I am trying to get a loan and Sallie Mae has reported me as being late for $75 and it is not allowing me or my co-signor to get another loan even though we rectified this confusion a long ago. They would call my co-signor and threaten legal action and say she was going to lose her house, etc. all for $75.00. Today, a gentleman called her telling her she did not qualify to be a co-signor.

2011-11-13 21:34:27,"Bullock, NC",Edward,1.0,"We are writing you to request your help in securing our money back from Sallie Mae.  While the amount may seem trivial ($2,000.00), this event has hit us during extreme financial hardship and what Sallie Mae has done is just plain wrong.  Sallie Mae applied our $2,000.00 payment to the wrong account.  The department handling the account is incredibly rude and Sallie Mae refuses to correct their error and has simply kept our money.  Despite this, we continue to make monthly payments against the subject loan.  Recently, Sallie Mae has been making harassing phone calls stating our payment is late, even though I have proof from my bank that the payment was made.  I associate Sallie Mae with the U.S. Government (inferring trust), but have recently learned that Sallie Mae was privatized in 2004.  Clearly, they are operating unchecked, destroying hundreds of peoples credit, making harassing phone calls and threats, and simply and illegally taking money.  I am shocked and alarmed to find literally hundreds of complaints with Consumer Affairs about Sallie Mae with very similar situations to mine (see attached).  Please take action to stop this abuse by Sallie Mae.  You are our last hope.The background for this issue follows: Louis ** secured a career training loan from Sallie Mae in January 2005 in the amount of $15,000.00.  Edward ** (brother of Louis **) co-signed for the loan.  At some point, Louis ** quit making payments to pay-off the loan and could not be contacted (his location is still not known).  Thus, Sallie Mae pursued payment from Edward **.  A $2,000.00, payment was made to Sallie Mae in the fall of 2009.  Sallie Mae applied the payment to the wrong account, even though the correct account was noted on the check.  Sallie Mae refuses to correct their mistake and apply the loan to the correct account.  We are asking your assistance in getting the $2,000.00 back or getting the payment applied to the correct account.  We are also asking that Sallie Mae reimburse or adjust the correct loan account for any interest or late fees applied to the account as a result of this mistake.  Details associated with this issue are below.A phone call was received around July 16, 2009 stating that payment by Louis ** against loan ** was late.  No additional information could be obtained on the account (e.g., account history, other loans secured by Louis **).  Sallie Mae cites privacy act as rationale.  A payment of $838.70 was immediately made to bring account to date.  Sallie Mae verbally indicated the balance was around $3,000.00.  We were unable to contact Louis **, although we tried using all available means (phone numbers on record, mail to address on record, etc.).In November 2009, we were told that a new account had to be set up for Edward ** attached to the loan that was co-signed (account number **) to allow the co-signer to obtain information and to make payment.  That account number was given as **.  Dennis ** (brother-in-law of Edward and Louis **) then paid an additional $2,000.00 on Edward **s behalf, citing the given account number on the check.  However, Sallie Mae applied the payment to other loan accounts that Louis ** had evidently taken out, but that were not co-signed by Edward **.  Since the $2,838.70 in payments was close to the $3,000.00 originally indicated as being outstanding, and because we did not know if Louis ** had made additional payments, we assumed that the loan was paid-off in full or nearly paid-off.  No statements indicating the status of the account (amount billed, balance owed, etc.) are provided to the co-signer by Sallie Mae, even in this circumstance where loan default is an issue.From November 2009 through December 2010, no communication was received from Sallie Mae.  And Sallie Mae was unable to provide copies of any such communication.  In January 2011, a payment demand notification dated January 21, 2011 was received in late January, threatening court action and garnishment of wages.  No other communication was received from Sallie Mae notifying Edward ** that there was an issue with the account.  In February 2011, Sallie Mae was contacted immediately after receiving the letter to arrange for payment.  We spoke with Ian ** from Sallie Maes collection agency.  Back payments totaling $401.23 were immediately made on February 1, 2011 to bring the account current.  Ian ** would not provide any explanation as to how the $401.23 in back payments were calculated, or how the principal balance of $2,561.58 was derived.  But he did state he would remove late charges associated with the payment.An account history was ordered from Sallie Mae on February 1, 2011.  The account history indicates that the $2,000.00 payment made in November 2009 to pay down the balance of account ** was not applied.  This resulted not only in an inflated balance owed, but also resulted in accrued late payments and interest that should not have been applied.  In addition, a $100.00 late payment was charged regardless that Ian ** indicated that this would be removed.  In March 2011, Valerie **, spouse of Edward **, spoke with Christopher (identifying number **) of Sallie Maes collection agency to resolve the issue.  Christopher indicated the following: (1) Citing company policy, Sallie Mae will not reconcile the account as the payment is older than 6 months; (2) Sallie Mae will not provide copies of any communication reportedly sent to us; and (3) while the records indicated that Ian ** had agreed to remove the late payment charges, he would have to call us separately on this issue."

My son took a semester off and volunteered in another country to help them with a project in his field of study. Well, because he did not graduate in 4 years exactly, Sallie Mae is wanting the payment in full. They are contacting my son 20 times a day when he is in his last year of school and working three jobs. When they cannot harass him, they call me and harass me at work. Each time, you speak with someone different and are given different amounts that you are owed. You send a payment and they don't apply it correctly. They asked for an amount to stop the calls but do not stop the calls. They are loan sharks and do not care how they get their money or by what means. Who is going to stop this?

From what I understood, the lady's name is Wynita. Well, Wynita was told not to call my fiance's work by my fiance; therefore she is not allowed to call there anymore, although she tried threatening this. She yelled at me the entire time without reason. I tried to calmly explain to her, in a pleasant tone, that he works 6 days a week and when he has time to deal with her phone calls I will make sure he does so. I doubt she heard that because she yelled the entire time. There needs to be a number to call or email to send complaints about certain reps to. Harassing people that are not involved in their scheme is terrible. Luckily, I laugh at idiots, it didn't have an impact on my day what-so-ever.

2011-11-08 02:08:38,"Feeding Hills, MA",Jannah,1.0,"As a single mother in nursing school with no family contribution, I took out student loans. I did very well in college, consolidated all of my loans in 2006 with Sallie Mae and went on to a master's program. My large Sallie Mae loan was supposed to be deferred while I was in school from 9/2007 to 9/2009. I began seeking employment in 6/2009 and quickly realized there were no jobs for new graduates during the recession. In 11/2009, I submitted an economic hardship deferment request to Sallie Mae and all of my graduate school lenders as well. I continued to diligently seek employment from 6/2009-2/2011, at which time I decided to go to medical school since I could not get a job as a new graduate advanced nurse practitioner. In 8/2010, I received a letter from Sallie Mae stating that my loan had defaulted. I did not receive any correspondence from them until this notice and it was already too late. I immediately called Sallie Mae and discovered that they had in their computer system that I graduated from my master's program in 6/2009, but I did not graduate until 9/2009. The customer service rep I spoke with said that if I can submit proof of my actual graduation date, then Sallie Mae would repurchase the loan and clear the default from my record. I promptly had my school submit proof of my graduation date to Sallie Mae. After verifying the documentation was received by Sallie Mae, the rep told me my loan needed to be reviewed prior to repurchase. This took many months and ultimately ended in a denial with no legitimate reason. They still have not updated the computer showing my actual graduation date.Additionally, they said they never received my request for the economic hardship deferment, which I have a copy of. I believe that my loan was in deferment, then suddenly it defaulted due to Sallie Mae's error with my graduation date. During the many months of debating and submitting appeals to Sallie Mae and the guarantor, the defaulted loan has gone to collections and my life is essentially in ruins because of it."

To date, my account has not been corrected and returned to a manageable status.From the start of my loan repayment term a year and a half ago, I have been an outstanding customer with no late payments. Payments for both private student loans were auto debited from my checking account on the first of each month for over a year with no issues. On August 11, 2011, I received an email correspondence indicating that I had a new student loan document waiting for me to review. After reviewing the memo sent from Sallie Mae, I immediately contacted the customer service department to inquire about my loan accounts. The following is a summary of what occurred.I contacted Sallie Mae customer service on August 11, 2011 due to the fact that I received a notification from them indicating that a forbearance that I requested had been approved. I knew this must be a mistake since I had never contacted Sallie Mae in the entire year and a half that I had been repaying my student loans. When I contacted the customer service representative, he indicated that they received a call from me (the week before) with a request for forbearance on my loans. I proceeded to explain to him that it could not have possibly been me who contacted them since I clearly had not and asked that he research a little further to find out what had happened. After several minutes of waiting on hold and several questions from me to assist him in his troubleshooting abilities, we finally discovered that one of my student loans had a co-signer on it which happens to be my aunt. After several more questions from me on how or why my aunt would call in to Sallie Mae concerning my account, it was discovered that my mother was actually the one who initially called Sallie Mae and requested the forbearance on her private loan. Further research into my account revealed that since my mother and my aunt had once shared the same California address, the representative who worked with my mother confused her student loan with mine. I was shocked as to how something like this could happen. The only similarity between our loans are the address of my co-signer, not the name, social security number or date of birth. This brought up another question. When I called the customer service center to inquire on my loan, I was required to put in an account number or my social security number and date of birth. How was my mother's loan ever confused with mine when we have completely different addresses, social security numbers and date of births? This is a very serious privacy and security error on Sallie Mae's part. There should have been increased security questions and protocol to prevent this type of mistake. This mistake by Sallie Mae caused my student loans to be taken off of automatic payment deductions through my bank and my website loan management to be shut off. When I asked the representative if I could have my loans reinstated through auto deduction, the representative indicated that they would take care of it immediately and my account would be back to normal. The representative told me to go ahead and send in payments for both loans through the mail this month and that the next month, my bank account should be auto debited for the remaining monthly payments.On September 5th, I checked my bank account to see if my September payment was deducted. It had not been taken out. I proceeded to call customer service again to find out what happened. After looking at my account, the representative indicated that my loan was now on hold due to the fact that I had filed bankruptcy. Shocked, I proceeded to explain to her that she must have the wrong account because I had not filed bankruptcy nor had I requested the original forbearance that caused this entire mix-up to begin with. One thing that I would like to point out is that during this entire time, I never received any correspondence from Sallie Mae indicating changes to my student loans. At this point, I was beginning to think that something was very wrong with Sallie Mae's customer service department. After one hour on the phone, two representatives and a manager later, it was discovered that my aunt in California, who was a co-signer on the loan, had filed for bankruptcy during the month of August which I was unaware of. The manager proceeded to explain to me that due to the fact that my aunt was a co-signer on my first private loan, this affected my entire account. When I asked how my aunt's financial incompetence could affect my loan's good standings, the manager indicated that it did not matter that I was an outstanding customer or that I personally had not filed bankruptcy nor that I was willing to keep my loan payments going to remain in good standing. My account was inaccessible.Frustrated by the entire situation, I asked the manager to give me a payoff quote for the first student loan that my aunt had been a co-signer on. I also inquired that if I was to pay off that one student loan that was attached to my aunt, would my remaining loan be put back to good standing? The manager indicated that yes, my remaining loan would be put back to good standing and I would also be able to re-enroll for the auto debit program. Wanting nothing to do with my aunt's poor financial management, I decided to pay off the entire loan amount that was connected to her. On October 14th, my payment was deposited into Sallie Mae's bank account. I waited one week after the funds were deducted to contact the customer service department again and inquire if my account had been cleared. I also wanted to see if my website privileges had been re-instated. After looking at my account, the customer service manager told me that everything looked in order on her end and asked me to try to access the Sallie Mae's website during the weekend to see if I had the ability to. After trying several times unsuccessfully, I contacted customer service again to find out why I was not able to log on to the website. Upon researching my account, the representative indicated that I would now have to wait 30 days after my payment was posted for the account to close and release the history associated with the loan. With so many options to choose from when deciding on student loan funding, I am amazed that such a large loan servicing company has proven to be so incompetent. As a good standing customer, my first inquiry should have been sent to a higher priority department to handle and should have been resolved immediately. Instead, it was up to me to debate with the customer service representatives and self-investigate what happened on my account. I will be filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and several loan consumer advocacy groups in the hopes that others will not have to undergo the same frustrations I have had endure."

As I read in other comments, they never seem to give me the correct amount that is owed and when I pay extra the funds are never applied correctly. To top it off, I'm paying on a loan where the school closed before I was able to finish. Doesn't that result in some type of breach of contract? Not for Sallie Mae. So, now I am stuck paying $10,000.00 for an education I never received. I am so sorry I ever got into this mess."
2011-11-01 09:50:22,"South Bend, WA",Gary,1.0,"I took out a Heal loan while going to school through a bank. Sallie **** bought my loan and the nightmare began. I borrowed around $9,000. I have been making payments of $100-$250 per month since around 1998. The interest rate on my loan has fluctuated between 4.25% to almost 8%. My minimum payment has fluctuated between $35 to $50 per month. Each time I send in a payment, I would ask if any amount I payed over the regularly scheduled payment would be applied directly toward the principal balance. I would write this on the check, on the payment slip and on an enclosed note. Not one time did they applied the payment correctly. They would just move my next payment due date further into the future. Every month I would have to call and argue with someone who kept telling me that it wouldn't make any difference in the amount I paid at the end or when my loan got paid off. After years of this ridiculous hassle, I gave up. I continued to send in extra payments with notes, but became so stressed out fighting that I stopped calling. I just want the thing paid off."
2011-11-01 02:22:40,"South Pasadena, CA",Angi,1.0,"Despite following Sallie Mae's instructions every month since June 2010 for extra payments that I want applied toward principal and not to advance the due date, I have to call or write them to correct their error because they continually advance my due date, thus pre-charging me interest instead of applying all extra payment toward the principal. Yes, they correct the error (at least I think) after I spend a lot of time on the phone and emailing them. However, I believe that five months of the same error is no longer incompetence but a deliberate act. Please investigate and see if other consumers who are trying to apply extra payments toward principal are having the same experience. I believe this may be a pattern of unscrupulous behavior on Sallie Mae's part."
2011-10-29 23:49:07,"Winston Salem, NC",Ruth,1.0,"Like everyone else, I only put one star because you had to put at least one.  Otherwise, I would give them negative.  When I found this website and read through the comments, I found that my experiences with Sallie Mae sound exactly like everyone else's.  I don't want to sound like a broken record, but you make a payment agreement with them.  Like clockwork, in 3 months you get calls every day from different reps not only telling you that you are behind when you're not, but by different amounts.  I had one say in a hateful way, ""Where did you get that figure from?  I asked her if she thought I made it up or pulled the number out of the air.You make the new payments and 3 months later, you start getting calls again.  I find out later, each time, that they have messed up, which you knew anyway.  But they say they can't fix it or perhaps they can if you send more money!  But it keeps happening and they notify the credit bureau, even though you're sending money and it's their screw-ups.Well, I've had enough.  I just filed a complaint with the Pennsylvania Attorney General's office and well see what happens.  If it's okay with this site, I would like to recommend that all of us file a complaint with the PA Attorney General.  On their website, one of the possible actions they may take is where there are a number of complaints against the same business, the Bureau of Consumer Protection may file a lawsuit in state or federal court seeking relief on behalf of consumers.  Maybe if everyone files a complaint, they will also see the pattern that Sallie Mae uses and force them to stop, fix their ""mistakes"", or file a lawsuit if necessary."
2011-10-28 23:43:53,"Camarillo, CA",Heather,1.0,"I am in school deferment right now and they still proceeded to take an automatic debit from me. Their customer service rep confirmed this prior to the payment being made and said it was ""too late"" to stop. Mind you, this was 5 days before my payment date. They then said my only recourse was to request a refund, which they would ""create a case for"" immediately. After 4 unsuccessful phone calls and 3.5 weeks later, I still do not have my refund that was promised within a few days. I am a struggling student and cannot afford to make 2 student loan payments right now. Furthermore, I feel that there is a serious lack of communication as they are obviously outsourced in India and only seemingly read off their script while trying to ""help you"". I'm beyond frustrated right now! Worst customer service I have ever received."
2011-10-28 03:12:06,"Calgary, AB",Amanda,1.0,"I would never give a star but because I have to, that is the only reason for a one star. I had a horrible experience w/ Sallie Mae and hate that I had no say in where my loan went. My loans like most were with Citibank until they decided to sell all of their federal loans to Sallie Mae in Sept. I had two loans with Citibank and could make extra payments on whatever loan I wanted to due to the fact they were extra payments and that Citibank had exceptional customer service. I had only $800 left on the smallest loan when the loan was sold to Sallie Mae. I called to let them know of my intention to pay it off and that was what I was going to do before it was sold. They said that everything would stay the same. Yeah right! I have been with Sallie Mae for 2 months and have had nothing but problems and been lied to. They informed me tonight that the policy is that they apply extra payments at 83% to big loans and 17% to small loans and there is nothing I can do about it, that I just have to deal with it. So basically they want to drag out the payments on my loans so they can maximize the most return for their pockets not worrying about what is best for the consumer. I am beyond frustrated with this organization and truly find it disgusting that Sallie Mae is able to take advantage of hardworking Americans."

I am getting harassing collection calls.  I have been enrolled full-time prior to missing a payment.  I cannot make them grant an in-school deferment.  Do I just wait until my credit is trashed before I get a lawyer involved?
2011-10-24 21:58:30,"Phoenix, AZ",Judith,1.0,"Please disregard the single star, it was necessary to submit the form. Apparently, they purchased my roughly $40,000 student loans from Citibank at some point in the last year or so. I have no real clue as I received no paperwork regarding the said purchase. Soon after finishing school, I got divorced, pregnant, lost my home, my job (unemployed for 13 months) and filed bankruptcy. Now, Sallie Mae told me that my $40,000 in loans is now $82,260.06. How did that happened? I told them I would never in my lifetime be able to pay that off. Do they understand the state of the economy? This is beyond ridiculous. I'm a single parent trying to make ends meet. We barely have the roof over our heads, food and clothing. I have nothing left. When I die, will they go after my children for this debt?"
2011-10-24 16:24:25,"Peoria, AZ",Debra,1.0,"I was unemployed back in January 2010 and moved to live with my parents until I found a job. Unsuccessful at finding employment, I went back to school in May 2010 till February 2011. Before going to school, I had up to 27 calls a day from Sallie Mae about my loans and even paid small amounts they suggested so they would not put me in default. As soon as I finished school, I was still unemployed and the school's student assistant team helped me with unemployment deferments on my student loans. Sallie Mae was included and I got a letter from them stating the deferment was in place but a few weeks later, they began harassing me and threatening default status again. I was told no record of deferment was ever given and that I was not eligible for my ""private"" loan. So I was told by the Sallie Mae rep to try to make payments monthly in an amount I could afford to forestall default. I did in March 2011 one month after I finished school. I made $50.00 a month payments on the private student loan against the $91.00 and change monthly charge. I received numerous threatening letters even though I was paying something. I did not have a phone for them to harass me on. I have gotten a full time job in September 2011 and started to pay $100.00 monthly against the $91.00 and change actual monthly payment and I'm still getting threatening letters demanding payment in full or I will be in default. My original loan balance was $3373.00 and I am told they want $8223.36 immediately. Can they keep threatening me? I angered them with my other student loans carried by them I consolidated all my loans with Direct Loans or it would have been much worse. I was signed in the class action suit against Sallie Mae but never heard anything about it."
2011-10-23 21:50:26,"Binghamton , NY",Sarah,1.0,"For a few months, I sent in an additional money by paper check following the directions on the SM website to apply extra money to my principal. They are now taking this extra money out of the account, via electronic debit, without my consent every month and I can't get them to stop. They have my approval to take my regular monthly payment out via EBT, but I was sending them additional money by paper check, not EBT. So they are getting paid twice a month from me now - once for my regular payment and once with this additional payment. Of course, this additional payment was never applied entirely to the principal, only in part. Because why would they play by their own rules? If I can't get this straightened out tomorrow, I am canceling EBT from my account altogether and I will see where that gets me. They have handled student loans for me since 1995 (no, not the same ones - one set was paid off, then I went back to school) and it was only in the last few years that things went downhill with them. I used to recommend them highly, and now they are just a nightmare."

Sallie Mae falsely accused me of not making a payment to Citibank and increased my interests rates and hit me with late fees.  I contested the claim and provided proof of my payments to Citibank.  I am very responsible and never made a late payment in my life.  Sallie Mae refuses to acknowledge the evidence I provided.  I even got Citibank to call them and confirm that my payments were always made on time.Sallie Mae has horrible customer service.  Representatives and supervisors refuse to take ownership of consumer's problems.  They recommend written correspondence and then don't acknowledge receipt of documents.  I have a feeling that my case will take a very long time to resolve (probably in the courtroom) and will likely cost me lots of time, money, and resources.

I have been requesting them via telephone since June 2011.  It is now October 20, 2011.  I have called more times than I can count.  And I have spoken to numerous supervisors who stated that they would fax me these documents from between 4 hours to 2 days.  I still have not received them.  What can I do?

Even if a person makes the monthly payments, and many people cannot due to the unemployment crisis, the interest rate is tacked on the balance at a horrendous rate each month.My son, an unemployed PhD.D has nine loans: private, Federal and Dept of Educ. He needs a forbearance or deferment for all but one which I co-signed and make the payments on monthly.We try to communicate frequently with Sallie Mae in order to eliminate confusion about what the latest bill is and address the numerous letters that come to our home. It was during the summer that I talked to Sallie Mae, getting a detailed status of each loan and making arrangements either for payment, forbearance or deferment. This was a mere two to three months ago. Today, I compared the preceding balances to those quoted today.The federal loan interests are not as bad. The others are no different than dealing with loan sharks. It is criminal and I am angry and disgusted. Even making regular payments, there is no way an indebted student can ever catch up aside from winning the lottery. This is usury at its worst, next to those check cashing businesses, which also exploit people."

I tried explaining to them that he was just a reference and should not be listed as a co-signer on the loan. No matter what I say, nothing seems to matter. Who is going to listen and do something with all these complaints? No one is willing to invest and find out what is happening. This leads me to believe, does anyone care and where is our government in all this? It's time for someone to wake up and take care of this monster that is going after people in a cruel way and lying about amount due.I told them that I was in the middle of bankruptcy as well and they weren't to contact me during it, and yet they continue to do so. I understand that my loans are exempt from bankruptcy but still, they must refrain from contacting me during this period. It is my understanding that the government officials' families do not have to pay student loans so I guess I have my answer as to why they are not doing anything about this. It doesn't directly affect any of them. We can bail out large companies that commit fraudulent acts, but we cannot help people with student loan bail out. Why?"

Two weeks later, today, we got another statement in the mail saying we owe a total of almost 20 grand.

I contacted Sallie Mae several times, with the last call ending with the Customer Service rep saying a refund had been sent out a week prior. A week later, no refund. I filed a dispute with my bank, who in turn refunded my money and contacted Sallie Mae, who in turn refunded the bank their money. I am now receiving statements from Sallie Mae that I owe them $159.00. They said the payoff was for all the loan amount except the $159.00. Yeah, right. Who would give a partial payoff amount? The payment I made on 8/8/11 wasn't predated, it was made on the day I sent it so they wouldn't have known on 8/2/11 that I was going to make a payment. So reasonably, why would they give a payoff quote for everything but the amount I ""overpaid"" them 6 days after they received the payoff?

This time I notified my bank, Washington Mutual, which then deducted the check from Sallie Mae and told them to deposit it again for the correct amount.As far as I know, they did, yet they continued to charge me a late charge for their error. I wrote them several times, called them only to be left on hold or connected to an operator who could not speak intelligible English, and I even emailed them numerous times, all to no avail. In the meantime, I have continued to pay $248.56 every month on time without fail. In fact, I have never missed a month nor have I ever paid late. However, the check I sent for October 2011's payment of $248.56 was cashed by Sallie Mae for $74.24. Again, I called, waited on hold, and was finally connected to an operator who refused to address the issue about which I called. Instead, she tried to say that I had not paid my payment in June of 2009. If that were the case, why were they just now claiming that?

2011-10-05 02:23:02,"Redondo Beach, CA",Schuyler,1.0,"Sallie Mae purchased my student loans from Citibank.  This has been a horrific experience.  And as a borrower, it appears we have no recourse with these crooks.  We have no choice who services our loans.  It's no wonder these people don't give a ** about their customers.  This needs to be changed!  I took my loans out with Citibank.  I was never late and never missed a payment with them.  I had even earned the 1% interest rate reduction on 4 of my 7 loans through Citibank.I was laid off in May of this year and called Citibank.  I did the paperwork and setup the deferment.  That went smoothly.  I went back to work and notified Citibank on 9/2/2011.  My loan statement cycles on the 27th of the month.  So, I was informed by Citibank on 9/2 that my next regular payment would be due 10/20/2011 instead of 9/20.  It was because the billing had already cycled for Sept.  Then, the problems started when Sallie Mae got involved.  Sallie Mae took my loans (3 on 9/7 and 4 on 9/8) based on the letters I received.  In the loan letters they sent, they immediately increased the interest rate on 4 of my loans by 1%.  I called Citibank.  Per Citibank, Sallie Mae had agreed.  And they are supposed to honor the interest rate discounts their customers had prior to Sallie Mae purchasing the loans.  As of today (10/4), they have not fixed this.To top it off, they said I was late and had a payment due on 9/20.  Citibank had specifically informed me that due to the statement cycling date, the next bill wouldn't be due until 10/20.  If Citibank had said I needed to make a payment on 9/20, then I would have done so.  However, I am confident that it would have changed nothing.Sallie Mae said they mailed a bill on 9/23.  This is a total fraud.  The bill they sent was dated 9/23 but wasn't postmarked until 9/27.  I have saved the envelope as proof of this.  The statement date on the bill they sent is 9/23.  So, these idiots generated the first bill (3 days) after 9/20 and mailed it 1 week (7 days) after 9/20.  Even in an ideal world, if I got the bill and mailed a check back to them by Friday (9/30), it would still be impossible to avoid a late fee.  It is my opinion that Sallie Mae did this deliberately in an attempt to charge late fees to increase their profits.  This is the very reason that Citibank said my payment after returning to work was going to be due 10/20.  Doing business like this doesn't give anyone a chance in hell to be able to pay their loans on time.  I am appalled at the audacity of these people.  Unless the borrower (me) screws up, I expect the lender to honor the terms of the loan I had with Citibank.At this point, they have done something, but I don't know what yet (as I don't have a copy of whatever new bill this is).  Now say I have a payment due on 10/20, but it is higher than the dollar amount it should be.  Thankfully, I do not use online billing/payment etc. for my student loans.  This has helped create the paper-trail.  And since Sallie Mae has so royally messed up my loans, I have no intention of ever letting them handle anything electronically.  There is definitely something to be said about having paper copies as proof of what has transpired as opposed to verbal or electronic methods.I have spent hours on the phone trying to talk to people in India that have no idea what an interest rate is or how they are even calculated.  I have been disconnected over and over again, honestly more times than I have been able to reach a person in India.  I tried again today (10/4) to call them.  I got disconnected twice after going through their stupid phone tree, which says it knows who you are by your phone number.  It asks you to put in your SS# and then puts you back into a different phone tree which.  Since it already knows who I am and it confirmed, it shouldn't (but it does) ask for your zip code!  I couldn't waste anymore time with these people as I had to get back to work.  And I had spent 20 minutes trying to get through between the phone tree and the hold times.Given the level of service I had received with Citibank, if something like this had happened with them, I would have confidence it would be resolved.  I have zero confidence in these crooks.  And it appears we have no recourse as borrowers.  I expect Sallie Mae to honor the terms of the loan I had with Citibank.  If every loan servicing company has the right to change the terms when they buy the loan and we have no choice who services the loan, how are we (the borrowers) supposed to have a chance in hell of coping with this?  Is there a way besides paying off and refinancing the loans at a higher interest rate to ditch these crooks?  Based on all the comments on Sallie Mae, I expect to descend further into the depths of hell with these crooks."

I borrowed $22k in one year and $5k the next year, so that I could afford to pay for my daughter to go to 3 years of college to become a dental assistant.  Times were tough.  So, I borrowed that much to help pay her car payment and car insurance for the 3 years she was in school.  I have since paid on time every month for a total of $6,223.34 towards the $22k loan.  Now, my balance is $33,800!  And on the $5k loan, I've paid $1,475 and my current balance is $7,500!  After paying almost $8k towards a borrowed amount of $27k, I would even be happy if they kept $7k and my balance would now be $26k.  But instead, my balance is a combined total of $41k.  Is there any help out there for us 50 something year olds who get sick every time I think about the money?  I have given to this company and the balance keeps going up instead of down."
2011-09-23 00:03:44,"San Francisco, CA",Kara,1.0,"On July 27,2011, I signed up for a three month payment plan to get my past due account up to date with a Sallie Mae representative, even though a previous representative, who I spoke with a month before, had already signed me up for this plan and took my money. I was told the previous representative must not have put it in the system correctly. This time, I wrote down all the confirmation codes and tracked my account. The plan automatically deducts scheduled payments from my bank account for three months.Every day since July 27, 2011, I have received 7-10 phone calls a day from Sallie Mae, beginning at 5:30 am PST.When I answer, a representative tells me that I owe $X on my account, they would usually quote a price around $945. I then provide them with my reference numbers stating that I am on the three month payment plan. After this, they realize that I am in fact on the plan and my account is up to date. They say, "" I do not know why we are calling you."" This has happened at least ten times.Each time I ask to not be called anymore, but they insist it is a computer glitch. Today, September 22, 2011, I spoke with Charles, a representative from Sallie Mae and we went through the same routine mentioned above. After determining that my account is in fact in good standing, I demand to not receive anymore phone calls nicely and firmly. While I am speaking, Charles cuts me off and says, ""You're being very nice. You just keep being nice. Bye now. "" He then hung up.Is there anyway to stop these calls and this treatment?"

And that they did not associate themselves with Sallie Mae.So can someone please tell me why they are being allowed to maliciously destroy mine and my sons credit for no reason? They turned him over to a company called Student Assist for collection of a student loan he allegedly defaulted on, when in fact my son and I both are still in school. How stupid is Sallie Mae organization and its employees?In addition, false documentation was provided to us via mail indicating my son and I ironically took a medical leave. When I presented the alleged documents to Wilberforce University, my sons school, and University of Phoenix, my school, its not even their documents. And neither school ever sent such information, indicating it is confidential and they can only advise Sallie Mae that the student is on a leave or has taken a break.When we question Sallie Mae where my son is concerned, they say the documents are not false and where I am concerned, they indicate I have no loan with them. So why the ** are you sending me bills, dummies?! And where my son is concerned, he has not taken a break other than summer break because the school Wilberforce University does not offer summer classes. Idiots! I believe there are enough complaints to warrant a class action law suit and we are seeking an attorney who is up for the task!I will personally do all the leg work, find complainants that will testify and bring evidence to the table.

We allowed our nephew to make payments, but in addition, I and my husband were paying $100/month. We already paid $3500, yet we kept getting delinquent notices. We called the customer service fifty times, only to get the runaround, and we were told that they applied the payments to the highest interest rate, regardless of who the co-signor is.This is absurd! Why in the world would I be interested in paying another co-signors loans? They had us fax all our bank statements showing proof of payment (we used banking online to send payments), and they still have not reapplied our payments to the applicable loans we co-signed for.

I've never missed a payment and though I've paid in almost $4000, the principal has only been reduced by $250 dollars. I've paid in almost half of the original loan value!I've tried to pay more, pay early, etc. The website changes so often that it's impossible to stay ahead of their diversion tactics. Early on, I went in and set up my account to pay more each date so that it would directly reduce the principal. But they changed my payment without my express written consent and reduced it to the minimum due, more than 6 different times. And low and behold, the place on the website to go and change it myself was gone. Talking to them on the phone is a nightmare. No one speaks English as a native language. The three times I've called and asked to speak with a representative or call a station that is located in the United States, I've been blown off after hours of trying to get in touch.I really wish someone (Newsweek, The Times) would do an in-depth look at their business and deceptive practices."

We never received anything; no statements of any kind, not even one per year.  Sallie Mae said that they sent everything to an email account which my son has not used in years.Now, they want an additional $1600 for the loan interest despite the fact that they never sent any statements.  We believed that the loan had been paid in full and six years later are presented with a loan that is about to go into default.  It is outrageous.  I don't have a problem with paying the loan, but I have a huge problem with being asked to pay an additional $1600 when I never received anything which lets me know that the loan is still in existence and accumulating interest."
2011-09-14 03:52:52,"Pacifica, CA",Jed,2.0,"Currently, there is no way to pay down a student loan principal via the Sallie Mae website, as you can with nearly every other loan.  If you pay more than your amount due each month online or by mail, they apply the surplus to future payments and not the principal by default; thereby, continually collecting interest from you on your interest.  The only option Sallie Mae provides is instructions to mail your payments to them with written instructions on how to apply the payments.When I do this, however, either previously undocumented interest arises precluding me from paying off a principal entirely, or they apply it to my next month's bill, despite my specific instructions to the contrary--thereby, continuing to collect interest on the loan.  I haven't calculated it yet, but this has probably cost me a few hundred dollars in interest over the course of my student loans.  If one were to multiply this by the number of individuals currently holding Sallie Mae loans, the money would be quite significant.Not having an online method of paying principals, applying payment surplus to future payments rather than principals, and the inconsistent and unreliable outcome of mailing payments collectively add up to unfair and intentionally deceptive business practices."

I follow their instructions, and then I get charged late fees.  I call again, make another payment, follow more instructions, and the same thing happens.  Every time, the information changes.  Every employee I speak to tells me something different.  I'm tired of dealing with people that don't know what they are doing.  It's not right that I have to make the same call for a month just to make a payment, and then have to pay late fees.  My payment would not have been late if I was allowed to make the payment on my first phone call.  I have tried to make payments over the phone with a person, but they are always applied to the wrong account.  And then, I have to again go through the process of calling a lot of times just to be able to get the situation resolved.  In regards to this last instance, my father and I called together.  We were assured that I was authorized on his account, so that I will not have issues making payments again (as I have had for the past 10 years).  Today, I called because I can't log on to make the payments and they tell me I'm not authorized. A few months ago, your employees told me everything was taken care of.  Now, I have to figure out a way to get a hold of my father, so that we can call together and try to fix this situation again.  In the mean time, I'm not sure when I will be allowed to make my payment.  And I will probably be charged a late fee because once again, I was told everything was taken care of, and it is not.

I also received a loan through Great Lakes -- both I was connected with through the school itself.Great Lakes was a terrific company to work with! My husband and I lost our home, went bankrupt, moved and have barely been surviving since 2007. Great Lakes offered a deferment of up to 1 year - not once but twice!Sallie Mae started harassing me! I was able to finally get a payment of around $112/mo for 1 year, but when the  time came for us to try and apply for a low income housing loan, I found that all deferments allowed (and paid for) through Sallie Mae showed up on my credit report as not being paid! Fortunately, we were still able to qualify for our loan.Now, my payments are over $225/mo. Apparently, the gentleman I spoke with and lowered my payments to a reasonable level failed to let me know that this was for a limited time only. I mean, charging this sky high interest rate of 13% -15% or more.I was out of work for over three months and the wolves have been at our door. I recently made a $25 payment over the internet to them and will continue to pay as I can. I spoke to a woman at Sallie Mae and when I told her I simply could not make the $225/mo payments, that I know I owe the money, I was told already that there was no more forbearance left for me. She told me that she could get my payments lowered and then she informed me that I could get them lowered by $40/mo! What? How is a payment of $190/mo much better than $235/mo? She might as well told me that they were now a million dollars a month! I then told her that I no longer wanted to be contacted by phone regarding my account and that I only wanted to be contacted via mail - to which she said she would note my account.Now, I do not answer the phone when it shows Sallie Mae is calling. It is always a recording. And these calls start around 8am  go to 9pm and I receive anywhere from 8 to 10 calls a day on my home phone. I get more calls since I asked to be contacted by mail only then I did prior.I have done credit and collections in the past and to think that they are allowed to get away with this type of harassment is deplorable!

I was just excited about school and now that I have graduated, Sallie Mae expects me to pay $1,400.00 a month for the said student loan.  I am now 24 and unemployed because of the lousy economy, desperately searching for a job.  There is no possible way I would be able to pay that.  Even when I did have a job at age 24, who would be able to make that kind of loan payment?  The worst part is that Sallie Mae would only allow me to take a private loan out for my funding, which has resulted in a $1,300 a month interest only capitalization (that's how much interest is being charged on top of my loan a month).  I feel like I have been scammed and backed into a corner with no way out.  I don't want to default on my loan but I really have no other options. I have called Sallie Mae countless times and most of them seemed not to care.  They only told me that I ""had to pay"" and there was nothing that they could do.  I feel that Sallie Mae has these types of loans to scam young college goers into paying them back for the rest of their lives without a second thought.  Once I am forced to default, they will have ruined my life before it even begins.  I wish I had never gone to school, which is a horrible thing to think.

By law, my loans will be deferred. However, I may make payments if I choose to. Well, they continued to withdraw from an account that I did not authorize.

To no avail, I finally ended up at a public transportation company which is nowhere near my field of study. When my student loans from Sallie Mae were scheduled to be repaid, I of course needed  forbearances and pricey deferments.  All of which were paid.  Then there was no more money to give them.  Sallie Mae then started calling my home phone and cell phone hourly for weeks on end!  They were not willing to accept anything but a $1,400.00 per month payment no matter what my financial status.  I can't tell how many different abusive people I spoke with regarding my situation.  It was like talking to a wall.  They couldn't comprehend that I couldn't afford those monthly payments or any monthly payments while being unemployed.  They told me to borrow money from someone!  How would I be able to borrow $65k from anyone with marred credit from Sallie Mae?Since all of my past dealings with Sallie Mae and being employed part-time since September 2008, I have religiously paid them $150.00 per month.  I have had the loans sent to collection agencies and receive threatening letters from them, but also continue receiving confusing correspondence from Sallie Mae saying I'm 60 days past due, 30 days past due, defaulting, etc.  There is no order in their mailings and have even been sent forbearance forms per my request that I never even requested!  They have even been mailed financial statements showing how much I make and where my money is going.  Sallie Mae continues to be relentless.  They won't even answer my written correspondence requesting where my $150.00 is being applied!As of four days ago, I have received a court summons.  Now Sallie Mae is suing me for the balance of my loans!  Threatening to garnish my wages and likely will for the rest of my life.  At age 48, this is the last thing I want to have happen, but have been told it's the process.  I can't understand the nonsensical business practices of this agency.  Does it make common sense to jeopardize someone's employment in order to get a loan paid?  My employer won't approve of this garnishment and then where will Sallie Mae be without any payments.  My credit has been marred so bad that I can't even get a better job.  How does this make any sense?  I thought they wanted more money?

It's not because of lack of skill or talent but because the institute that I attended taught me programs that became obsolete on the same semester of my graduation.  I've kept my student loans in forbearance for quite some time, and recently had applied to extend the forbearance of the loan I hold with Sallie Mae Services.  I faxed them all the information they had requested, along with a request to be notified once the application cleared.  I was not notified that the loan forbearance was denied until nearly three months later when the late fees had stacked up to nearly $1,000.00 and they requested that I pay the amount in full immediately.  I paid the amount of the loans but not the amount of the late fees.  I requested that the late fees be removed because Sallie Mae had not notified me of the denial of the forbearance application, but I was denied yet again.  It was time to make a point and show Sallie Mae Services that if they truly wanted to go head to head with me that I wasn't going to roll over and play dead. First, I sent an inquiry to Sallie Mae asking if I were allowed to send them multiple checks over to pay off the late fees on my loan while also mentioning that I did not feel the late fees were fair due to their lack of correspondence.  I received a ""yes"" answer, which gave me permission to make my payment using multiple checks.  I went to my bank and upgraded my bank account to one that allows me to receive and write unlimited checks at no cost to myself.  I have ordered over 14,000 checks and I am postdating them for the beginning of next year.  Each check is written out for one penny. You may be asking yourself why I would want to write out so many checks for a cent a piece in order to pay off my late fees.  The answer is simple.  All business have to pay a check processing fee for each check that they receive and the cost of those fees is always more than one penny.  Once I have written penny checks for the bulk sum of my late fees, I will ship them to Sallie Mae with a thank you letter for their email correspondence stating that I greatly appreciate them allowing me to pay my late fees with multiple checks, and may continue to do so with the rest of my loan payments.  If it were to cost Sallie Mae one penny per check to cash each of my checks for a penny a piece, they would be breaking even and not actually receiving any money from my payment.  However, it is highly unlikely that they will only be paying one cent per check and in turn will actually be incurring a loss by cashing my payment. Sallie Mae has already granted me written consent allowing me to make my payment with multiple checks, and if more and more people would follow my lead, I believe they would have no option but to clear the debts of those who have gone to the trouble of paying their debts in this manner back to zero or otherwise suffer huge losses in processing fees that far surpasses the amount of the payments being made. Sallie Mae has forced me to fight back and its unfortunate for them.  I'm more intelligent than they had given me credit for.  I will include in my shipment of the multiple checks, a letter stating that by not accepting my payment, I will be left to assume that they have decided to clear my debts back to zero instead of incurred the cost of processing fees of one cent per check.  I requested to receive my ""thank you"" letter nonetheless stating that my debts have been paid in full.  The final step in my actions against Sallie Mae is to spread the word of the method I'm intending to use to make a point.  Sallie Mae can knock us down, but they shouldn't expect us to not get back up and start pushing back."
2011-08-16 20:42:20,"Wyoming, DE",Roberta,5.0,I applied to Sallie Mae and was turned down several times.  I went to Wesley College in Dover.  My parents paid several thousand dollars out of pocket. I only went to Wesley for two semesters and have been making payments directly to Wesley. I just spoke to a man who told me I owe $7000 to Sallie.  I asked him to put it in writing and he said no.  I want to explain how I could owe Sallie Mae when I never received a loan from them or finished school.
2011-08-09 01:56:28,"Tuscaloosa, AL",Meredith,1.0,"I have a large amount of student loan debt. I have not graduated. I work a full-time job, and have a daughter. I barely make enough to pay mortgage, daycare, bills, and have anything left for groceries, gas, diapers, etc... I have paid Sallie Mae $150 countless times for the 3 month forbearance just to get a break from the harassing phonecalls. They start calling right after 8 AM and will continue 8,9,10 times a day until 9 PM. They call my co-signer the same amount of times. I am completely fed-up. We recently lost our home in the tornados that hit our state. I told Sallie Mae the situation. That we couldn't do anything to our home for 3 months, that we are living in an apartment, our expenses have sky-rocketed, and income has gone down due to loss of time at work. They did give me ONE month forbearance at no cost, and told me they would mail out forms for me to apply for a hardship deferment. I never received the forms, and they won't fax or email the forms. Long story short, they have reported me and my co-signer to the Credit Bureau. I feel horrible, but I can't do anything. The payment is over $400 a month....that is more than daycare! I need advice. I am trying to find some way to consolidate or refinance. I have to get out of this trap. They are ruining me. I will gladly pay my payment on time if they will just give me a reasonable amount."
2011-08-07 01:07:29,"Abbeville, LA",Joan,1.0,Sallie Mae raised my interest and put interest late fees on top of that after I asked for a deferment and after we went on disability. I was charged $50 to defer for 1 month then they added late fees on top of that. Horrible company.
2011-08-07 01:01:20,"Abbeville, LA",Joan,1.0,"This company contacted me by phone in March saying if I I would pay $390 for four straight months, my debt with Sallie Mae would be done. I agreed. I paid $390.00 on March 1, they gave me the transaction number 110228, March 16,2011 and was given transaction number 110315, April 22,2011 with transaction number 110421 and May 17,2011 with transaction number 110516. I paid as agreed then today I received a bill for $556.14.Their integrity financial partners mission statement states that 'trust is integrity operating principles, support the management team, established history of performance excellence'.They said if I pay those four payments of $390, Sallie Mae would stop their horrible 1% daily interest on my unpaid balance. What a lie!"
2011-08-04 13:09:33,"Lanexa, VA",Lisa,2.0,"I graduated in 2008. Well right before I graduated, I had to have a cornea transplant. My vision in my eye was not up to par. I called Sallie Mae and told them to defer my loan due to surgery. They charged me 150.00 for the deferment, which is just crazy. Then in May of 2009, I had to have my other eye done. So now, I have them both done.  Well needless to say, I had to defer due to surgery.  In Feb of 2010, I lost my job.  Now I have been unemployed for a year and a half.  They will not help me.  They said I should have not taken out the loan, and I told them they should not be crooks.   Now I have a torn ACL and meniscus in my knee.  I dont have insurance, so I dont have money anyway to get my leg fixed.  And they want money? My husband is trying to pay all of the bills, but we just dont have the extra money they want each month. I cant even get insurance. If I had known what the monthly payments would have been, I would have never gone back to school.  This is the craziest thing I have ever seen.  Dont get loans from Sallie Mae cause they are cold hearted. We as people did not know the economy was going to fall and now we pay."
2011-08-02 15:59:45,"Island Lake, IL",Beau,1.0,"This company is more like a con or loan shark than a student loan company.  They sent out a bill and I paid it.  They did not mention that the bill was for one of three loans.  Instead of applying the payment to the loan that the bill was for, they spread it out over the three loans.  This made the payment for each loan less than the minimum payment, making me late.  They then charged me $25 for each late fee.  I made the full payment the next month for all three loans.  They then took that payment and spread it out over the three loans toward the earlier shorted payments!  They then took what was left and applied it to the next three payments, which shorted those payments incurring another $75 in late fees.I have incurred late charges before due to billing but this company is ridiculous. I would suggest that you tell everyone you know not to use Sallie Mae. Pass it on! Do not use this company for anything!"
2011-08-01 22:00:56,"Commerce Twp, MI",Abdul,1.0,"I graduated university in 2009 and had continued taking some class in order to pursue a grad degree. Things changed last year when I lost my part time job and I have been searching for jobs. I even left Michigan where my home base is and have been working to support my self. Couple months ago I recieved a call from Sallie Mae harraising me about my loan. After a brief argument, it was decided that I pay them 150 and my loan will be defurment for then next 3 months. Ironically I got a call from Sallie Mae again following month claiming that my loan is passed due by 2 days and that my account is going to be sent to collections if I do not make another payment of 150. After going back and fourth, I made a stupid payment for 150 again and was told again this time that now your account is on Defurment as the last 150 was covered to pay for previous balance. As of yesterday just a month later, I have started recieving calls again from Sallie Mae asking for another 150 to defurment my loan. I work part time currently and am pursuing to attain a full time position. Sallie Mae is a company that is out to ruin people. I am sick and tired of their customer service reps who are rude and I honestly think that they take your money that they like to lable as the fee and keep it in their pockets. I would really appreciate any help of advice I can get from anyone here who is experienced with Sallie Mae's practice and know of a legal way of resolving this issue."
2011-08-01 21:58:25,"Findlay, OH",Cathy,1.0,"I have been paying on my student loan faithfully for several years; it is taken directly out of my bank account. I recently had a $2000 cut in pay and am having a hard time making ends meet. I received a letter from Sallie Mae stating that my payments would be increased.  I cannot pay any more than I am paying right now.  I called them sure in the knowledge that common sense would prevail and that they would agree that I could continue to pay the $50.08 that they have been collecting every month.  They said NO that I would have to pay the increased amount due to the timing of the end of my loan.  According to Sallie Mae, I agreed to pay off my loan within the next nine months; I never heard of Sallie mae until I received this letter.  I did not agree to anything with them. My loan balance due is $486.43.  We are quibbling over $33.21 and 1 month.  So instead of paying off my loan in the nine months they say I agreed to, I will pay it in nine months with a partial payment of the $33.00 on the tenth month. But Sallie Mae says NO, I must pay the increase so that I will pay off my loan early."
2011-07-27 15:23:23,"Prior Lake, MN",Karen,1.0,"I cosigned a student loan for my son in 2007.  He graduated, but has not found a job, so I have been making all the payments.  I have documentation that I have made every payment on time.  Sallie Mae has continually harassed me despite the fact that I sent them a cease and desist letter.  They have put a blemish on my credit saying I am behind.  I have sent them letters, with the proof from the bank that all payments were made, and they still say that I am behind.  This is all because I make electronic payments.  Sallie Mae's left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing.  They take my payment every month and divide it between all my sons loans, and tell me I never sent a payment.  I think that illegally, they are using my money to pay loans that do not have my name on them.  I have tried over and over to get them to fix the problem, because it is on their end.  The phone calls keep coming, email, even with a cease and desist order."
2011-07-25 19:47:25,"Charlotte, NC",Ingrid,1.0,"I am very upset with Sallie Mae student loan. I recently lost my job and tied to get forbearance for 3 months or until I find another job. The customer representative told me that I have to pay $150.00 to apply for forbearance! What part of ""I have lost my job and I don't have money"" they didn't get? I asked to speak to corporate office, but the male with accent told me that he is not allowed to give me corporate office number and that corporate office does not speak to customers. Every time I call, I get customer representative from another country. Last time I spoke to Vincent Long, but I am not even sure that it is his real name.Anyways, what kind of company does not have corporate office or manager I could talk to? I was told that I have to pay $150.00 for 3 months forbearance, because they are private loan company. I am a international student and I am trying to keep up with my payments and good credit history. Sallie Mae doesn't cooperate with me. I have another private student loan, which accepted my forbearance without any fees for 6 mos. If I knew that sallie mae are screwing people like that, I would never apply for this loan. I have cosigners and I don't want to let them down, but sallie mae makes it impossible. All I asked is to give me a break for a couple of months! I lost my job and now I have to suffer because of this ignorant company. Is it even legal not to have corporate manager to help customers? How come there is only one number we can call and that number is in INDIA or Philipines (I don't know) with people with phony names? I never even once spoke to a person without accent!  Now I don't know who I can contact about my loan forbearance. There is only one number and corporate office is not available to help us. If anyone have any advise on how I can get to Sallie Mae corporate office, please let me know"
2011-07-25 15:24:21,"Huntingburg, IN",Kevin,,"I went to school in 2003 to 2007.  Each month, I made my payments on time, so when I missed one, they put me into default on my loan.  I got a paper in the mail stating that I have to pay in full.  Two days ago, I got a paper stating that if I cannot pay the balance in full, they are offering a monthly repayment plan.  When I called the recovery department, they said that I have to pay in full before I can make payment arrangements.  Is there anything I can do."
2011-07-19 18:26:10,"Wilmington, DE",Jessica,,"I was directed to use Sallie Mae for private loans to enroll in college beginning in 2005. This was the best choice I was told, since ""I am attempting to pay for school as an independent student, and would not involve my parents."" Sallie Mae approved my loan applications and financed a good portion of my education. The interest amount attributed to said loans has reached astronomical amounts. Due to personal matters, including bouts with anxiety and depression, I medically withdrew from college for a few semesters. I continued to work, however, and I still did not reside with my parents. I always had an apartment; I never lived on campus or with my parents. During these hard times, Sallie Mae continuously called excessive times daily (sometimes 10+ calls before Noon.) demanding payment IN FULL. My grandmother co-sgned on loans, and they threatened to take her house and any assets she may have, if she did not pay them IN FULL. I argued with Sallie Mae for YEARS attempting to reach an agreeable payment schedule. Never at any point did I flat out tell Sallie Mae I could not or would not pay them. I just could never afford what they were asking: ($700+/monthly). That was more than I was paying for rent. I re-enrolled in school and will graduate in the Winter of 2011. I set up a payment plan with Sallie Mae that adds up to approximately $350/monthly. While enrolled and taking classes, Sallie Mae ignored my deferment status (which they suggested), and reported negative payment statuses to Consumer Crediting agencies, continually lowering my credit score."
2011-07-19 14:40:09,"Dothan, AL",Margaret,,"My son has a student loan, and he is a full-time student. This is supposed to be deferred while he is in college full-time. He began in 2005. I have a tuition assistance loan along with him and was protected under the deferment (as well as SCRA, while his daddy served full-time in Iraq 2007-2008). Last summer, out of the blue, I received a phone call at 9:00 at night, and on a Sunday morning, from Sallie Mae. I told them his loans were deferred, and he would begin paying on them when he graduates in 2012. Right after that phone call, letters started flying in with unbelievable amounts and compounded interests with both of the loans."
2011-07-13 17:41:11,"Flushing, MI",Ashley,,"I did not give my cell phone number to them but I called in to talk about my loans. They put my number that I used to call them into the system. I told them I was not giving my number and that they were not allowed to call me. Well, I have just received calls. I told them it is my cell phone and not to call me again. What do I do? I know they are calling me illegally."
2011-07-11 18:28:52,"Morrisville, NY",Michelle,,"I had taken out a loan with Sallie Mae so that I could go to college. I should also add that my fiance also took out a Sallie Mae loan, and that I co-signed for him. We have been having economic hardships, as I moved in December 2010 for an employment opportunity. Therefore, I had to pay rent and a security deposit for a new place, and I paid a lot of money to heat my new place during the winter, as it is very drafty. My fiance remained at our last place of residence, as we had planned to wait for him to get a job before he moved down here. However, his car broke down and we could not afford a new car. So he moved to our new place, and he was unemployed for a few months. He JUST got a new job. I haven't been able to make my student loan payments because of my financial situation. I realize that I'm at fault for not attempting to make a payment, as it is my responsibility to pay Sallie Mae back for the loan. However, I think it is evident that my financial situation has not been most favorable.A few weeks ago, my parents, with whom I no longer reside, told me that Sallie Mae left a message on their answering machine saying that I need to contact them soon, or my account will be out of their hands. I immediately contacted them, gave them my updated address, and made a payment to them over the phone. I told the representative that I did not want my parents contacted because I no longer reside there. I also requested that information be sent about the amount overdue, and about how to get my loan put into forbearance and she said that she would send the information to me. However, I have not received anything from Sallie Mae yet.Yesterday, I got a call from my parents, and they said that they there was a message from Sallie Mae, and they had left the same message as before. I was appalled because I had just made a payment, and it had not even been a full two weeks since my payment was withdrawn from my bank account. Today, I contacted them, and I first addressed the issue about them calling my parents about my loan and leaving messages regarding the state of my account. The representative asked if they co-signed my loan, and I responded in the negative. She then seemed to brush off that complaint, and said that she needed to forward me to my ""account manager"". I was then forwarded to my ""account manager"", who seemed rather friendly and respectful. I then asked him why my parents were left a message when I just spoke with someone about my loan account a few weeks ago and had made a payment. He then asked me if I was asking about my loan, or the one I co-signed, and I told him I was concerned about my loan. He said that he was the account manager of my fiance's loan, and forwarded me onto someone else. The next person I spoke with was very rude. She told me that my account was way overdue, and that I had to start making payments of about $367 for the next four months to make my account current. When I told her that I cannot afford to make those payments right now, but that I could pay small now and then kick it up when I'm done with my car payments (which end in September), she said that I had to pay that money by the end of the month. When I asked about the payment I made a few weeks ago, she said that that payment does not show on my account, and that it was credited to my fiance's account. First, I find it appalling that I made a payment to my fiance's account without my knowledge, as I thought we were discussing my own account. Second, I'm appalled that they keep hounding my parents, even after I told them that I no longer reside with them. I am also troubled that they left a message regarding the status of my loan, even when I told them that I don't live with them. Lastly, I find it offensive at how they treat you over the phone, and that even when you are trying to make an effort to get back on your feet and catch up on payments, they use their scare tactics to try to make you pay more than you're able to.Dealing with them has caused me a lot of grief and stress, and I was left feeling powerless with regard to my financial situation. They just seem to lack a level of understanding and compassion for those who are really struggling to make ends meet. I'm baffled with their conduct, and am nervous about having to deal with them for many, many years while I try to pay back these loans."
2011-07-06 01:18:36,"Maynard, MN",Michelle,,"My Dad and I co-signed on two loans with sallie mae for my son. He has tried to keep up with the payments. Sallie Mae is calling my parents all the time, finally they told my dad that they would take a settlement on the loans if he would pay them off, he agreed to that and settled to pay for 85% of the loan, they told him to deposit the money in his bank account and they would withdraw it. They would not send him anything in writting. My son at this time worked out a payment plan with them for his loans. A couple of days later they called him at work and said he had to make another payment he argued with them that he had made his payments and was current after almost an hour the supervisor got on the line and said ""Oh we just wanted to say that we called to tell you we rejected your Grandfather offer and yours!!!  IS this legal? I told my dad to not deposit the money in his account until he had it in writing what they agreed upon. Can anyone help or give us some advice?"
2011-07-02 16:42:31,"Richmond, VA",Rita,,"Regarding student loans, Sallie Mae is also very abusive to their clients and they need to be regulated as well.  So please check into Sallie Mae complaints online and help those people.   Educational Credit Management Corporation in St. Paul MN, GC Services in Houston TX, Columbus in Ohio, and ACS Affiliated Comp Services in Long Beach CA also have many complaints reported against these companies mentioned above.  Please regulate these companies or shut them down for not following FDCPA laws.  They are embezzlers, tax fraud, scammers, con artists, federal felons and also grand Larcens to the max. Please don't let them get away!"
2011-06-25 00:17:49,"Moraine, OH",Richard,,"This also involves Sallie Mae. They are making over the top calls to me and my work. I called Student Assistance Corp. back, this Jeffery answered and would not give the address. He said he would continue to stalk me. He and the others constantly make threats saying they are going to get their money, no matter what, and they are operating as such, acquiring ridiculous fees. Someone needs to sue these people, Sallie Mae and Student Assistance Corporation, and hold them accountable. The government (which is us) bailed them out and they are trying to make money. This needs to stop! I've also found my computer to be being under attack constantly. I believe they have hackers working for them. They gather lots of personal information, which would allow them to go untouched, pretending to be me or others that have e-mail accounts, etc., and disrupting everything about me and others' lives. It's organized crime without a gun."
2011-06-24 03:25:24,"San Gabriel, CA",Rebecca,,"Sallie Mae added 30% penalties in late fees and collection fees to my student loan.  Is that legal and do I have any recourse?  They have since sold my loan to Nelnet.  After a divorce, being a sole provider for two minors and a grandchild, I filed for bankruptcy, and of course, student loans cannot be included.  So a $6,000 loan became a 9,000 loan and it's still not paid off.  I'm still paying on it."
2011-06-15 00:46:52,"Sacramento, CA",Lani,,"This was the worst customer service experience I have ever come across. I was looking to apply for a student loan and decided to call to do the application because I had a few questions. The first lady (unfortunately, she never provided her name) was rude and kept cutting me off every time I tried to ask a question. Halfway through the application, I was fed up with it so I politely asked her if another representative could finish my application. She got very quiet and asked, ""Why?"" I simply told her I would just prefer to finish up my application with another representative. She then got very quiet and hung up on me!I was furious! I then called back to try and put in a complaint and finish my application and got a gentleman on the line. He was nice. However, I could clearly tell he kept talking to someone else in his office. He would mute his line for 10 seconds, at a time, and when he would un-mute it. I could hear them laughing. I cannot be certain, of course, but I have a feeling he was laughing about me with the previous representative who hung up on me. He ran me around in circles with the application and kept asking me the same questions over and over and over. I was so fed up with it I told him I would do it later. Based on this experience though, I will never do business with Sallie Mae, ever."
2011-05-27 03:38:49,"Puyallup, wa",Michael,,"I am a graduate of my school with an associate degree of applied science using a few different student loans. But one has come to my mind and my family's headache about repaying my loans. I have borrowed only a small amount of money under 7,000 dollars at a est 7% interest rate. Now, I have a good credit of repaying a lot owed money like chase, credit card companies. but Sallie Mae is the worst right now to me cause it is ruining my credit score of stating that I have a due that was pasted for 15 days. Now over the past two weeks, I never receive any letter of a payment needed to be paid. Only received was everyone else asking me to pay back. In my life since I graduated school, I've only received one letter that needed to be paid to Sallie Mae. after that, I did not receive any more letters until I got the letter of a due being pasted. Everyone else from chase and my credit cards are sending me monthly bills and Sallie Mae only sent me one overall.My family had received monthly bills from Sallie Mae when I started my classes. They only received only 4 bills until they got a phone call saying we were 3 months pass due. Only my dad and I was signed in loans.To anyone who is planning on using Sallie Mae, don't. They are a joke at reminding you to pay your loans and will ask every member of your family (they did it to my grand parents) for money like loan sharks."
2011-05-25 23:06:35,"Canonsburg, PA",Tracy,,"I had a student loan in 1984. In 1999, during my divorce, I found out that it was still unpaid. The original loan amount was $2,500. I immediately contacted National Payment Center (NPC) and asked what I could do to pay this now $5,000+ with interest and fees off. I set up a repayment plan in which I had the payment automatically withdrawn from my account monthly. After making 9 consecutive monthly payments, the fees were to be waived and 1/2 the interest deducted. Sounded reasonable and I did my part. When the 9th month was upon me, which I was looking forward to, I received a letter indicating that my loan had been ""sold"" to SLM Corporation (Sallie Mae). Yes, ""sold."" NPC made a nice profit off of my loan that made up for the promised waiving of my fees and 1/2 the interest, because my new balance with Sallie Mae was now over $6,000 which was more than the initial amount at NPC, and 9 monthly payments! I was shocked that this could even happen. I mean, I never bought a car, got down to the last few payments and had the bank call me and say, ""Hey, we just wanted to let you know that we sold your car loan and now your new balance is $25,000 when you were down to 2 more monthly payments of 299.00 or something."" This is outrageous.How can this be allowed by our government? A government that bailed out a greedy banking industry and allow the oil industry to gouge us daily? It is obviously fine to let the general public rot. I continued to pay and, finally when I called in September 2008, to see what my balance was after paying on this originally $2,500 for almost 10 years and over $9,000, I was told I still owed over 4,000! How is this possible? Is it the new math?They never sent a statement. I wasn't making online payments and had no way to follow my payments, no receipts were ever given. It is all very backroom, As bad as Sallie Mae is, I must say I was even more appalled by the lack of interest or help available. I contacted Senator Specter's office. Senator Don White's Office, The Attorney General's Office, and they either immediately dismissed it or said, ""We will send you some forms to fill out."" (Do make some paper airplanes with them because we just do not care. Okay, they didn't say that last part, but I sure felt it loud and clear. )There is a very interesting dynamic at play here. When you are an average person and you have a debt, even if you are in the process of making it right, you are just a deadbeat who did not have the foresight to better manage your money or your life. But if you are a bank, a corporation, the government is happy to find a way to help you out. By taxing me, who is paying a $2,500 loan over and over?Now my daughter who has a 4.58 GPA is looking to go to school. I applied for her Parent Plus Loan. I was denied. I make $83,000 a year. Aside from this loan and my bankruptcy in 2005, my ex-spouse  split with the state the money from our house the 401K, sold our furniture and I raised 2 girls on my own and filed since he also left me bills. I worked very hard, made something of myself and paid my bills. In 2008, when they said that I owed the over $4,000, I made a mistake. I took a stand and said, ""no more"", and stopped paying (and tried to get someone involved in investigating them). Specter, White, the Attorney General , Gloria **,  various agencies, the ACLU and even the press did not seem to care. I feel that my civil rights are being violated. I am being extorted and it has caused harm to my girls and to me.I recently reviewed my credit report after being denied, and there is Sallie Mae listing me as 120 days past due. Funny that the amount they listed was $2,500 and not the $4,000 + they told me. I have been paying on this loan. I set up payments with ECMC once it became evident that no one was going to help me out. I am down to $1,500. I intend to pay this last little bit off with a full payment before they can resell it and start at a nice high amount again. I contacted ECMC because they were also showing up on my report and they said that they would take care of it since it shouldn't be on there. I am in fact in good standing and even have my Title 4 rights now reinstated which means I can qualify for federal loans. The representative at ECMC told me to call Sallie Mae and have them remove the negative report from my credit report since I am not 120 days past due. I don't even have a loan through them any longer, but after 3 hang- ups and talking to 9 different individuals in India I believe (Go America), I was told that they cannot remove this and that it stays on my report for 7 years!I thought only the bankruptcy would stick on my report that long. I have really no debt, just this $1,500. I pay in cash and have a great job. I am responsible.I represent a company, yet I spent the afternoon trying to reason with a mental midget at Sallie Mae who did his best to try to make me feel like a loser. I just want this removed from my report so my daughter can go to school and we are not using Sallie Mae to fund her education. I would actually sell a kidney first!"
2011-05-16 23:57:36,"Dexter, MI",Sandy,1.0,"I co signed a Sallie Mae loan for my niece.  Well, my niece decided to drop out of college so the loan came due.  Long story short, she has not made any payments on the loan, is not talking to me, and has moved.  I get phone calls day and night within 2 days of the payment being past due.  As far as I know, they have made no attempt to contact my niece.  I have asked for proof of this to no avail.  I have even provided them with her new address (via her mom) and phone number.  But they will not change anything because I am not the primary borrower.  When I ask why they are making no legal attempts to collect from her and hold her responsible, their response is that I signed the loan and am equally responsible.  That is funny!  I do not get the benefits of writing off the loan payments (I have been making the payments).  I do not receive any statements in the mail (apparently it is illegal to send 2 bills for the same account).  I cannot get any deferments or forbearances because I am not the primary borrower and the list can go on and on.  How is that equal?  I want to find an attorney to help me.  I feel that Sallie Mae is not being equal when trying to collect their money.  I want to keep my credit in good standing.  But who is going to hold the primary borrower responsible?  Shouldn't they exhaust all their options with the primary borrower (ex: garnish wages etc.) before going after the co-signer?  What are our rights?  Now after reading some of these complaints, even if I did pay it off (if I could), they would try to find some reason that I would still owe money.  There has to be something that can be done.  This is nuts!"
2011-05-12 21:01:39,"Bradenton , FL",Bill,3.0,"In 2002, I went to a heavy equipment operator school. I got a loan and co-signed with a private school loan with Sallie ****. This was not a government student loan. Just after coming back from school, I had an auto accident and I couldnt work for 6 months. I also couldnt pay the loan they offered but they let me buy it out in 2005 for $2,100. I did that for 3 payments of $700 but I lost all my stubs. Now, a credit agency is saying that it is almost $13,000 and its $6,000 on my credit report. It says on the schools website that they do not have government loans for this school. These people have been messing with me and my co-signers for a credit of 10 years trying to hide behind the gaze of a government backed loan. Help! Im trying to straighten out my credit."
2011-05-12 03:52:33,"Winter Springs, FL",Steve,,"This debacle starts a little over two years ago when my wife was about six months pregnant with our second child. Up to this point, I had been paying Sallie Mae using the automatic withdrawal from my checking account method. Things were going well. Unfortunately, my wife's boss started to realize that with a baby on the way, my wife was headed for some maternity leave and he would have one less employee for a few months, so he fired her. I only mention it because I believe that it is important. Our finances got a little tight and I had to switch to paper billing through the mail. It afforded us a little more time each month to make the pay. We struggled and were on the verge of losing our house, so I requested a deferment of my payments.After my deferment period had expired, I didn't receive any bills. When I called to inquire, I was informed that I owed some money due to missed payments and, of course, there were some late fees associated with that as well. I asked how this could have happened. I was told that I was responsible for mailing in my bills because I was now on the coupon' method of repayment. I informed them that I had not requested the coupon option and would prefer to go back to receiving my bills in the mail. Sallie Mae's customer service department could not figure out how my account was switched to coupon payment. I spoke to several different members of Sallie Mae's staff on multiple occasions (monthly) and the problem was never resolved, despite the fact that they had assured me each time that it had.A short time later, I contacted Sallie Mae to try and find a solution to my problem of not being able to make a particular payment on time. I was waiting for a check to be mailed to me. I had not received it yet and I was unable to pay my bill at that point. When I spoke to a Sallie Mae representative, he assured me that I could avoid the late fee by switching my due date to a later date in the billing cycle. He proceeded to switch the dates for me. Later that month, I was informed, via a barrage of phone calls, that I was late on that month's payment and there were some additional late fees as a result. It seems that the due date switch cannot take effect until the next billing cycle, negating the reason I had the switch made in the first place. My customer service help' failed to inform me of that. Of course this error, his error, resulted in fees I had to pay.My next phone conversation with Sallie Mae was concerned with trying to get my account back onto paper billing, again. For some reason, my representative could not make this adjustment. They suggested that I use Sallie Mae's online payment option through their website.Frustrated with all of my previous attempts to resolve this situation with customer service, I was willing to try anything. I went to the website and created an account in an attempt to pay my bills online. I reviewed, checked off and paid every due amount I could find on the web page, associated with the billing groups on my account (the website is unable to display them all on one place, apparently). Still, a month later I received a volley of phone calls indicating that payments were missed and, you guessed it, additional fees were due.Adding insult to injury: Feeling financially overwhelmed, I decided to apply for an income based repayment plan. I tried to fill out the documentation on Sallie Mae's website, but I was confused by some of the wording of the questions and opted to fill out the forms which I downloaded from the same site and just fax them in to the number provided. I never heard from Sallie Mae.Having no real alternative, I had to call Sallie Mae customer service for some help with this new issue. I called during the week, during normal business hours (I have learned to never call after hours or on the weekend, since the help' available at those times is even less adept) to try and find out what had happened with my submission. At this point I had also learned to never talk to the standard Sallie Mae staff, since they could not solve any of my issues. In fact, they tended to make matters worse. I immediately asked for a supervisor, thinking that this will enhance my chances of success. In addition, I have started asking for names, full names. Corey **, if that was his real name, was the supervisor I was working with.The first thing he said was ""Wow, your account is a mess!"" He then proceeded to ask me when I filed the income based repayment documents. When I told him that I wasn't really sure, he gave me a hard time, indicating that I should know that information. I made a guess off the top of my head as to when I submitted the paperwork. He rudely piped in and informed me that it was actually a month after the date I had given him. I could not figure out why he would ask me for the information if he had it in front of him, on the computer, all along.Feeling like I was being verbally reprimanded, I asked him if he remembered every date associated with forms that he had ever filled out. He very snidely said to me: ""If it's important to me, I do it and I remember"". He then indicated to me that I had filed for income based repayment online and no action was taken since the form was incomplete. I told him that I that I was aware of that and that I had filed a second time with a fax. He told me that no action had been taken since the paperwork was not received. Feeling extremely frustrated, I asked him to send me the paperwork, via the mail, again. It's been over two weeks and I have still not received my income based repayment documentation. Obviously, Corey had not followed through on his responsibilities. I wasn't sure whether Corey ** job wasn't important' enough to him or if he was just a liar, but I wanted to call and find out. Seeking some measure of accountability, I called Sallie Mae and asked for Corey. I was put on hold while he was located. I sat on hold for 48 minutes. At that point, I hung up in frustration. Had I not done so, I would probably still be on hold, waiting.In my desperate search of Sallie Mae's website for some answers, I came across an interesting quote which is sited as being a Sallie Mae slogan. It reads: ""Customer Service is not a department, it's an attitude"". As a customer, I didn't really experience a great deal of service, but there was certainly a fair amount of attitude.The solution: Despite all of this, I am still willing to try and salvage this situation. If Sallie Mae is at all interested in making things right, this is what I propose. (1) Repair my damaged credit rating. All of these issues have lead to late and missed payments, none of which are due to any errors on my part. In addition, I have exerted considerable effort in trying to rectify the situation to no avail. Therefore, I do not believe that I should be penalized for them. (2) Waive all outstanding late fees associated with late and missed payments. Again, these fees are directly associated with my inability to work with a competent member of the customer service staff and as a result, I do not believe that I should be penalized. (3) Return me to paper billing. Just mail me my bills, all of my bills, clearly indicating the amount (s) owed for all of my billing groups.I believe that these are very reasonable requests and my argument is well founded."
2011-05-05 17:26:07,"Eugene, OR",Amanda,,"I was never told my deferment would end while I was still in school. I had a deferment until 2007 then was in repayment until 2008 which I paid. I even negotiated terms to pay what I could actually afford. When I decided to go back to college, I applied for another deferment and was granted one originally until 2013. Here it is May of 2011, I am still enrolled in college full time. I have been laid off from full time work and now only work 16 hours a week. And Sallie Mae collections starts emailing me and calling me to tell me that I am two months late and need to pay immediately. When I question them, I got told to send in a school certification. I asked why I got treated like I am an idiot and was given the same answer repeated over and over.I have now applied for a deferment twice and been denied twice for ""reaching the maximum deferment time."" Nobody told me there would be a maximum and I am still in school until at least December so I am very confused. I have even tried a voluntary forbearance and the guy who helped me apply, customer service agent from Sallie Mae, said I should be granted an in school deferment and that I easily qualify for one. I desperately need help sorting this out because I honestly cannot afford to pay them back right this second but after I am out of school and working definitely, but not right now. My family is still trying to get back on our feet after my husband lost his job in January of 2009."
2011-05-04 23:40:47,"Saugerties, NY",Susan,,"I received a letter that my son's school loan was being written off as a debt. I am the co-signer. The letter said they were open from 8:00 am - 9:00 pm so I called and I called and I called and the date to call by goes past, and I called yesterday 7 numbers! Today, it was 4 numbers. Finally, someone said they couldn't help me. I had to call the number I had been calling. What also is upsetting is early last year, I made an agreement for them to take money out of my account. After 3 months, it stopped. I called but no one could help me or send me papers, etc. What do I do?What is resulting is a debt in my name when I am trying to find out and settle this. I acknowledge they have tried to call me and when I realized that my son defaulted on his obligation, and I started calling them, but nothing."
2011-05-03 16:49:42,"Austin, TX",Chas,,"Pay us your money and just go away. That's what one of their senior managers told me when I tried to settle my account with them. What a bunch of low life's. I had to wait until the end of the month to pay them because that's when I got paid. I called Sallie Mae's toll free number on Saturday (866-812-4251) but the offices were closed. I called that Monday, and was told that I could not settle on our original agree terms because it was too late. I told them that I tried to call but their offices were close (I have phone records to prove it). The manager (his name is Jeremy) said that's not true and they were open. The number I should have called was 866-573-9891. How the ** was I supposed to know? It's best that you stay away from this company. Something wrong with their business plan (I think that's why the dept. of educations is taking over all their loans. The government has figured out that their incompetent)."
2011-04-22 16:27:19,"Ewing, VA",Robin,,"We have requested several times for a payment reduction form from them and they refuse to send one. It has been several months and they have late fees and harass us several times. I had counted in one hr, they called 4 times. How many times can you explain something to them? If they refuse to send the paper work to your house to fill out, what are you going to do? They tried to put the wrong address on a bill and I still got it. I told them that was spelled wrong; these are very sneaky tactics to do, to say they mailed something out buy putting the wrong address on it . They threaten on the phone when they call, they have no respect to the person they are talking to. My husband can talk to them some days and some days they will not talk to him, considering that I have made request for him to be added several yrs ago. They refuse to do what government law is on student loans."
2011-04-14 17:12:52,"Great Neck , NY",Tara,,"They never told me that I had a late payment from 2007, no letters nor email correspondences. I have an auto-pay set-up so that every month they just deduct the agreed amount of monthly payment. I went online to check the progress of my new income-sensitive repayment plan submittal and saw that my current amount due was more. I called and they told me that I had a late fee. To pay it over the phone would have cost me money so they said I could pay it online which I did. I checked and saw that my payment was taken but not applied to my late fee so I called. They said it was applied to my interest and they would fix it to go towards the late fee and it would take 4-7 business days.Well, it has been a month and I am now on-hold with Sallie **** because it wasn't done and I am being told that all payments made go to interest first before late fees and that I have $4,000 in interest but they will try again. I am on an income-sensitive repayment so tell me where I am going to pull $4,000 dollars out to be able to pay my late fee. I am also thinking that my interest due is also going to increase so I will never be able to pay my late fee and they will keep reporting my late fee to the credit agencies thus affecting my credit. This is so absolutely ridiculous. Half of my loans due are now all due to interests. I accrued them when I got sick and had to put my plans on forbearance until I got better and then was able to work and have an income that would allow me to pay back my student loans. If I had known when I was in college that I would be at the mercy of Sallie **** for my life, I never would have gone. Dealing with them is impossible and I just cannot bear it on my own anymore. I am sure that I am not the only one they are putting through the ringer like this which is so morally corrupt. They need to have their business practices investigated."

However, Sallie Mae does offer a new start loan together. In 2006, Congress no longer allows couples to consolidate student loans but failed to grandfather in those of us stuck in a consolidation loan.Despite many pleas, requests, and discussions with Sallie Mae, I am still stuck with my ex-husband's loan of almost $100,000.

When my son was in college, I co-signed a loan for him with Sallie Mae. My son then joined the army, he took care of his obligation and sent them the military deferment papers. So far, so good. Well, not so much! My son was deployed in Iraq last year for 455 days. Within one month of his deployment, Sallie Mae began calling me and depending on who called, I was told: They need his contact information, I gave them the information for Fort Hood where his unit is stationed and where his wife and child live. They asked for his orders, okay sent. They said I have to pay, not happening! I have written to them and told them to stop calling. I have written to my congressmanWhen I told them to call his wife at Fort Hood, they told me ""well, maybe she doesn't have the authority to talk to us on this"". I informed them that while he is deployed in a war zone, she most certainly does have the authority! I told them to file papers and have his pay garnished, they said ""do you know how long that would take?"" Seriously, it is not my problem! They call 7 days a week from 8AM-9PM. He is not a deadbeat, he is serving our country in Iraq.My wife and I have raised 3 children, put them all through college and are now living paycheck to paycheck just to keep up the mortgage payments. I, too, was in the army. I served in desert shield then desert storm, only to be told they didn't need me after 18 years and let me go as a Major with an honorable discharge, but without a pension and benefits. Now, I have to deal with this. I don't know what else to do and they have made it clear that they will continue to call me until they get paid. This is beyond harassment. Our stress levels are high enough with my son in Iraq and now we have to deal with this on a daily basis. Please, what else can I do?"

This was after I wrote long-term unemployed, which requires the unemployment form for deferment.  I have sent a congressional inquiry to get this company investigated for continued mishandling of finances and cost of financing (the rate was made 8.5% after being shown in writing 4%).  I want everyone to send letters, emails, and telephone calls to their congressmen and senators.  This is to ensure that Sallie Mae is thoroughly investigated, and loan process is brought back to simpler and lower rates for students and parents.  Also, this is to bring the education process back to learning, not being swamped with huge, outrageous interest and ""private"" loans to be banned from the process.  This is where Sallie Mae has shown the most financing fraud, similar in all ways to the mortgage fraud brought out in public!"
2011-01-27 18:53:43,"Mount Airy, MD",Tim,,"I was enrolled in Income Based Repayment (IBR) in 2010 because my student loans exceed my current salary.  On December 12, 2010, I received an email from Sallie Mae telling me that my IBR payment plan would ""expire in approximately 90 days"", with instructions on how to renew.  But Sallie Mae did not give me 90 days.  My IBR plan expired on January 1, 2011 raising my once manageable payment of $210.00 to over $600.00 in less than 30 days.  I even sent them back the requested renewal form within 15 days.  But they told me I could not re-enroll in IBR until my past due amount (the $600) plus the late fees are paid and my account is brought back even.  I could not do that in the time they requested.  And now I have late fees accumulating.  They received an additional form I faxed to them on January 20th, 2011.  I was informed that it would take 3-4 business days to process.  When I called today, January 27th, 2011, the form was still not applied to my account.  Every time I call Sallie Mae, I get a different answer from that representative.  And no one seems to want to help me get my payments under control.  I have copies of the correspondence and bills from Sallie Mae."
2011-01-20 21:12:14,"Fairfield, CA",Charmaine,,"I have sent multiple applications to work out a repayment plan with Sallie Mae along with all supporting documentation requested (e.g. proof of income, tax returns, W-2's). I have attempted to make a repayment arrangement since August 2010. Each time, they tell me that I need something different or I am missing documents or the application was completed incorrectly. However, a representative from their Student Assistance Department told me that she had reviewed my file and that there was nothing wrong with the application or the documentation that I sent over time and she didn't know why they denied my request for the repayment plans that I requested. She even said that one note said that I didn't submit my family size on the application but she could see that, in fact, I did. I believe that Sallie Mae is working to set me up for failure as each time I call, they tell me something different, and they tell me about policies that they do not have in writing and that are not written on the application forms and then tell me that is why they denied my application form. I am not in default but if they keep doing this, I will be in default due to their negligence. They are also charging me for loans that are on my credit report which they do not have promissory notes for and that I did not borrow. They say that this is the interest that has capitalized over the years and has now become part of the principal. Well, that amount is equal to the amount of the loans that were initially taken out (25k) and that doesn't include the interest. I don't believe these practices are lawful or ethical. I want to repay but it seems that they are playing games so that they can make me go into default to have a reason to begin to garnish my wages for an amount that would be far more than I could ever afford and cause me to not be able to live. Something needs to be done about these practices that they are implementing. Their own staff told me that there was nothing wrong with the documentation that I sent in and she did not understand why they keep refusing my payment plan, and of course, when I spoke to a supervisor, she said that wasn't true and they don't hold applications on file more than 30 days. Is there a record retention law of at least 7 years or does it not apply to them in this category? I need help and justice! Thank you for looking into this matter for me."

I requested to speak with her supervisor; she refused to allow me to speak with her supervisor, and she hung the telephone up on me. I called again and I spoke with representative named Kevin, and I requested to speak a supervisor. He wanted to know the nature of my problem, and refused to forward me to a supervisor until I submitted a payment. I told him that I was going to make a payment, but I would like to speak with a supervisor. He again requested to know the nature of my problem before transferring me to a supervisor. When I told him that I had a customer service issue, he responded, ""We are not the customer service department, we are the collections department. So, what do you need to speak with a supervisor about? "" I responded that I have an issue with the company's customer service, and I need to speak with a supervisor. He denied me the right to speak with a supervisor. I requested several times, but I was continuously denied the right to speak with a supervisor, unless I was willing to pay my bill. I again informed him that I intend to pay my bill, but I would like to speak with a supervisor. He denied my request and hung the telephone up on me. I called again and this time I got customer service representative named Fredrick. I asked him for the telephone number or the address to their complaint department, and he said, ""um"", and placed me on hold, then hung the telephone up on me. I called again. This time I spoke with a customer service representative named Charles. I requested the address or telephone number of their complaints department. He provided it to me. He then stated that my account was outstanding, and he gave me a different amount that was past due on my account beside what I was previously told. During our conversation, he told me that I needed to bring my account current, and I told him that I would, after I spoke with a supervisor. As I'm getting off the telephone, he told me, ""Your account is in collections and it will be ongoing in collections."

Each month, the payment is deducted from my checking account by Sallie Mae on the 15th. This month, January 2011, no attempt was made to debit my account but rather they sent me a notice through their e-correspondence center that I was delinquent and also that my payment was being increased from $160/month to $430/month. They are asking me to pay $600 to clear the delinquency when they have not even tried to withdraw the payment. My checking balance never goes below $1000 and my bank and Sallie Mae agree that no attempt was ever made for the payment. They sold me on the automatic payment idea because, ""You will never have to worry about late payments. If I had not been on their website looking for my 2010 tax forms, I might not have noticed this until they reported this error to the credit agencies. Back in 2008, they reported millions of customers as delinquent to credit agencies just as I was buying a house. It screwed up my credit score for a month until they reversed their error. It looks like they are at it again in January 2011.They are claiming I am delinquent and asking for nearly $600 to clear up my account. That is nearly 4 times my normal payment and also threatening to report my ""bad credit habit"" to credit agencies. I have done nothing wrong and they are using their intentional mistake or error (I can't be sure) to extort money from me. I have no problem making my payments each month automatically, but they have not even tried to withdraw the funds."
2011-01-05 16:40:44,"Cranford, NJ",Marcel,,"I co-signed for my daughter's loans and I'm being taken to court for wage garnishing. From the onset of the payback period, Sallie Mae has been unreasonable with any negotiations that we tried to make to get the payments that my daughter could handle. They refused any adjustments and I encouraged her to just pay what she could while we worked on resolving the problem.Needless to say, nothing was resolved. Although they were getting something, one of the loans went into default. If they were taking what we sent and putting a little on each loan as they said they were, then how did this happen? Also, as much as we requested consolidation, why would they not offer it to us until after the loan defaulted?Her loans started in 2003 and the loan that defaulted was from 2005. Is that because it was the higher loan (which, by the way, has now more than doubled)? Now, because I'm the co-borrower, they are trying to set the payment amount according to my salary instead of negotiating with my daughter. They've illegally called my job and harassed me. I am fully aware that the loan has to be paid, but why should it be at the expense of causing hardship on me and my family? I contacted them and like what they have been doing to so many others, they refused to adjust the payment to something we can afford. They were ridiculously unfair.I feel that Sallie Mae loans are a ""set-up"" scam, taking students and parents for granted. When is someone going to challenge their wrong-doing and check their records? I would not recommend them to anyone. They are constantly sending mail to my youngest college student and I just toss it in the garbage as soon as we get it.Times are really challenging and people are losing homes and jobs. The children are moving back home in an effort to survive and Sallie Mae can care less about any of it."
2010-12-28 02:15:18,"Manhattan, KS",Stacy,,"In 2007, I took out a Career Training Loan with Sallie Mae for $4000. The tech school I went to have no other options for financial aid and pushed hard for students to do a loan through Sallie Mae. It was a terrific mistake. The loan terms indicated that the loan would not need to be paid until 6 months after graduation. Unfortunately, while this tech school took 18-24 months to complete, Sallie Mae thought it took only 10. At 16 months, I was told I had to start paying the loan back. It was a fight to convince them otherwise. I finally convinced Sallie Mae to correct the length of my attendance at school from 10 to 18 months.It is now the end of 2010 and I have discovered that Sallie Mae did not correct anything. Instead, someone put forbearance on my loan for several months and, therefore, using most of my eligible forbearance time. About 2 years ago, I filed for 6-month forbearance and was approved. There was a charge added to my principal balance but otherwise the forbearance went smoothly. When I asked for an extension, I was turned down but without a reason being filled in on the form letter. I called the U.S. office I had called before but it was disconnected. After weeks of investigating online, I finally decided that office no longer existed. The regular 888-2SALLIE number had representatives that could not help (nor understand) me, so I gave up trying to find out why my forbearance was refused. Due to losing one of my 2 jobs recently, I applied for forbearance again in early 2010. My application was ignored. I tried again with a letter; also no response. After a third try on November 2010, it was approved on December 10. I received an official letter telling me so on December 20. On December 27, I began to get harassing calls from Sallie Mae telling me I was delinquent. Knowing this wasn't right, I checked my online account. It suddenly said I was delinquent, being reported to credit agencies, and now owed late fees. There was no forbearance on my loan anymore and no indication what had happened to it.As an aside, I should note that Sallie Mae charges late fees for no reason. They delay processing and I have about a 50% success rate in getting these fees removed. The delay also causes their system to register me as late and Sallie Mae will call both me and my relatives listed as second contacts on my loan immediately when this happens. That's why with this current problem, I called Sallie Mae immediately because I didn't want my relatives harassed again. The first person I got seemed confused and she seemed to notice immediately that there was something weird going on with my account. I was disconnected. (Again, I note that over 50% of the time I am on the phone with Sallie Mae, I am disconnected and have to call back.) I got a second representative and told them the situation. This representative was confused, gave conflicting information, and wanted to argue with me. I'm not even sure he was looking at the correct loan. He told me the forbearance had been ""canceled"" 2 hours after it had been approved. I told him I had received no notice of this, and he said that it didn't matter. Before I could ask what he meant, he continued by saying the forbearance was denied because I was out of forbearance time. That's when I found out it was because they had used my eligible forbearance time when I was still in school. This was done without my knowledge.He also said my current forbearance was canceled because my co-borrower had not signed the paperwork. I do not have a co-borrower and told him so, at which point he laughed and called me a liar, claiming he was looking right at my forbearance application. I asked who the co-borrower on the account was, and suddenly he couldn't tell me. Then he said I had to pay them $50 as a ""forbearance application fee"" and once I did, the forbearance would be approved. At this point, he began to push hard for me to give him my checking account info for that $50 to be withdrawn immediately. I asked how they could process forbearance when I was out of forbearance time, and he couldn't answer. I asked about the co-borrower business, and suddenly he said that didn't matter. This whole time he was pushing for my checking information, and I refused to give it to him. I told him I would deal with the situation online, thanked him for his time, and I hung up. I paid them online and sent them an email demanding the late fee be rescinded immediately. I will be sending them snail mail as well, complete with the same information I am reporting here. They will also get a copy of the letter I am sending to the BBB in complaint.This resulted to about $100 in late fees that were due to their delays in processing. (It was $200 total, but about $100 were eventually removed when I complained.) Loss of eligible forbearance time. Loss of cell phone minutes (approximately a $50 loss over the course of this loan) and harassment by Sallie Mae every time they erroneously believe my loan payment is late."
2010-12-16 16:35:11,"Cincinnati, OH",Devonna,,"I thought I was going to school to better my education for my children.  So I signed up for Southwestern College.  Everything was fine until I got really sick and missed one week of classes.  I had a doctor's note and I even made up test and passed exams.  I started working two jobs so I was not able to start back right away.  They told me when I had taken out the loan that if I left at anytime, as long as I returned back to school, I would not owe until after I finished college.  Well, some months later, I was getting mail stating that they had sent my loans to a creditor.  To put the topping on the cake, I had GED classes that they were not even making important to attend.  So now, I can't go to any school due to their loaner who won't budge a bit for small payment amounts.  I would like to go back to school but I cannot because Sallie Mae will not take my loans out of default.  I am really hurting at this point because I can't find a job and my family is in debt.  I would at least like to go back to school that will make me feel a lot more confident."
2010-12-12 10:51:22,"Memphis, TN",Rachel,,"A few months ago, I went into a financial aid office to fill out a FAFSA for a new school. That's when I found out I was in default. I've been trying to get in contact with Sallie Mae since October of 2009 because I was in another school at that time and was trying to get an in-school deferment. Long story short, I had my (now former school) send faxes to Sallie Mae. I mailed letters to each department at Sallie Mae, emailed and called them.Every time, they gave an excuse of not receiving it or told me to send more information. As time passed, they started harassing me, calling everyday all day even when I was still in school in Ohio. They told me that I was going to go into default and I needed a forbearance. I signed it and sent it. When I called, they would say they received nothing so they kept sending forbearance forms for me to sign, but never helped me. I would sign and send them (when I would call, they'd give me the runaround ). This went on about 5 or 6 months until I found out I was in default about three months ago. So when I was in the financial aid office for the new school I want to attend, we were there almost two hours trying to find out were my loans were because each Sallie Mae representative gave us a different number to call, transferred the call or just would hang-up. They all kept passing the buck saying they didn't know anything. I honestly don't think I should be in default because I did all I could. They wouldn't help. I knew I couldn't pay it because I was still in school. If they weren't so busy harassing me, they could have helped me. I wouldn't have needed a forbearance or been in default if they would have done there jobs when my school faxed all the information in October 2009. I'm still very young. Why should I have to suffer not being able to go to the schools I apply to or in my future buy the house or car I'd like to because someone else neglected to do their job?"
2010-12-09 03:29:03,"Las Vegas, NV",Robin,,"They are trying to reach a person by the same name and keep getting me. I have verified SSN, DOB, schools and everything to prove that it is not me they are looking for. I was told the other day that the supervisor can remove my phone number from the ""unbuzz"". But I swear, I just received another call from them. How do I get this to stop?"
2010-12-07 05:21:33,"Charleston, SC",Sarah,,"Aside from the harassment, etc., which is so typical of Sallie Mae, I was finally able to consolidate my federal loan with them into my federal loan through the government. Thank God. While I was waiting for direct student loans to disburse, I had to make a payment to Sallie Mae.This happened back in September. Sallie Mae was overpaid by $48. They have refused to refund the overage to me. I have called; I have been given the runaround; I have emailed. Isn't this illegal? How long can they hold on to this overpayment? For all the times they called me 12 times a day over a $5 late fee that accrued because they didn't post my payment immediately (really, I sent the payment on time, they posted the day after it's due, assessed a $5 late fee, then call twelve times a day because I'm in default for $5). I want my money from them, even if it's less than $50. What a wretched company that preys on kids fresh out of high school."
2010-12-06 21:53:38,"Florissant, MO",Valarie,,"My student loan payment is $130.63 which goes on my two loans, one subsidized and the other unsubsidized. When I send in $200 payment and I ask them to put $130.63 towards my payment and the extra $70 towards my principal, they never will. They divide the $200 payment and pay equal amounts on both loans (principal and interest). I've called on several occasions to ask why they're not applying my payment the way I've asked and they give me some formal rhetoric. I've even sent one check for $130.63 for my monthly payment and a second check for $70 to go towards the principal and they take the two checks and make them one amount of $200.63, which they apply on the principal and interest of both loans equally. I'm trying very hard to pay my school loans off quickly but I'm not being allowed to do so through Sallie Mae. Is there anything more I can do about this? At this rate, Sallie Mae will not allow me to pay off my student loans early. This could cause a financial crunch for me in the future. I thought paying off my loans early was a good thing; instead I feel like I'm being penalized for trying."
2010-12-04 23:55:52,"Soledad, CA",Jennifer,,"Please see attached letter that I posted on the web. This is in response to a recent letter that I received from EdFund informing me that my student loan is two months delinquent, and that I need to pay immediately as well as pay a penalty fee. I am a very busy widow with four children. I work full time as a Transition Teacher for the Soledad Unified School District. I could not find work in the Santa Barbara or San Luis Obispo area, so I moved away from my extended family. My oldest son currently lives in Idaho with my mother because this area is plagued by gang problems and he did not feel safe here. Despite the pain of separation, I guess I am relieved to be employed, but only make enough money to pay rent, utility bills, buy gasoline and food for my family. I don't dare call Sallie Mae because I have been through this before. They will not lower my payments so they are manageable for me."
2010-12-03 15:02:03,"Gaston, SC",Kristi,,"I took out student loans to complete my education. I went back to school prior to completing paying the 1st student loan. I graduated in July 2010. I have been paying on that loan and sending the money to an Atlanta address that I was told to send it to. I have only received one statement prior to this. I have been paying and they are cashing my checks. Yet, I am still being harassed and told that I am behind. Come to find out, someone at that company has given me wrong information. I have no idea where my money is going."
2010-12-02 18:09:52,"Fairfax, VA",Jim,,"On a weekly basis, I repeatedly receive harassing phone calls within days of talking to someone regarding my account. It appears that the communication, follow through and knowledge by among their phone staff is inadequate and incompetent. I have spoken with numerous people, some more knowledgeable than others, regarding my loan repayment options. Each time, the person demands I make a payment before reading the notes/discussions on my file. As you can imagine, this can be cumbersome and frustrating of having to repeat the previous conversations over and over again. In one of the most recent conversations, I was told that someone would follow up with another department regarding my income based repayment application. A few days later, I received another harassing phone call about making my payment. Upon request to speak with a manager, I was transferred to a senior account manager. This senior account manager said the person I spoke with did not follow up with the IRS handling department as she had stated she would do to process my application. Also, after discussing my forbearance letter with the same senior account manager, he adamantly proclaimed that I did not receive any recent forbearance because I was not eligible and that I should send in any documentation verifying my statement. I faxed in this statement on Nov 26, 2010. Since then, I have received two phone calls and spoken with four people who adamantly proclaim I was not eligible and did not receive any forbearance. On Dec 3, 2010, I spoke with another senior account manager. He originally stated that I did not fax any information for my new unemployment application which was sent on Nov 26, 2010. I told him that I just confirmed it was received through another account manager. He continued looking and then stated I sent in the wrong forms. I debated with him that I sent the forms through an electronic fax account, and I can see the receipt and forms that I sent. He stated he needed a minute to continue looking at the documents received on my account. He located the correct documents I sent and advised me to resend them with a new date. For the record, most conversations are handled this way.Please note that during my forbearance period, approximately two months, the phone calls stopped. Once the phone calls resumed at the end of my forbearance around the 11th of October. I spoke to a representative who stated any past due balance would be added to the back of the loan. As per the forbearance letter, ""You must resume making monthly payment at the end of your forbearance."" I have made my monthly payments for October and November. This past week, I received a coupon book indicating my new payments would begin December 4, 2010. The representatives harassing me state I have a past due amount and of course, never received forbearance."
2010-12-01 15:17:59,"Sonoma, CA",Alexis,,"I cosigned on a student loan for my sister, in agreement that I would be released after two years, as long as my sister made 24 consecutive, on-time payments. Those were the only stipulations (which she adhered)! After 10 phone calls, I have yet to be released. Sallie Mae changes their story every minute, different representative, different story, guaranteed! Sallie Mae is in breach of contract that I made with them. I am determined to be released from this loan as it is my contractual right. P.S. Do not every get a loan with Sallie Mae, unless you want to be screwed over and waste your time fighting for something that is already yours."
2010-11-23 19:39:10,"Baltimore, MD",Shana,,"I am seriously regretting my education right now.  I have been out of school since January but I am finding that it may not have been worth it.  I was only able to find a temporary position and I am being overdosed in work that I am not being paid for.  I am not making any more than I did as a student worker, and I have a degree!  My loans have troubled me and I was able to have some consolidated and thus payments have been lowered.  Unfortunately, Sallie Mae shows no mercy.  They never sent me any bills and they just have them on my online account.  I am now delinquent two months and they are threatening to send me to collections on the 30th.  I have called several times, even before receiving a delinquent notice, to try and make arrangements.  My payments are $300 a month and the only thing they offered was a payment of $222.  I had just told the person I spoke with that I was completely tapped financially and she offered no help, just a $88 lower payment. Then, if I pay $150, they will grant me a forbearance for the months I am behind but then next month, I need to pay an additional $150 or I will be in default again.  The only response I received was sorry, it's a private loan so there really isn't anything we can do. Really! I understand that I took out the loan, but lenders need to be realistic.  I am trying my best honestly but times are just not what I expected when I started school in 2004.  All I need is a payment plan and I have no problem paying Sallie Mae but $304 a month is just not it.  I do not know any graduates at this time who are making enough to begin their life as an adult and make loan payments.  I am fighting just to find a job and making a decent amount in this economy overall. I am severely stressed.  I am now choosing between car, insurance payments, food, bills, other loans and Sallie Mae.  I feel like I am in between a rock and a hard place."
2010-11-22 21:47:00,"Opdyke, IL",Debbie,,"I've been making (more than double the) payments on a student loan since February 2010 and after June's payment, they capitalized interest on my loan and charged me an insurance premium. When I called them, they can't tell me why I got charged the insurance premium or why my loan got interest capitalized. I pay more than the interest each month and actually are paying down the principal. I was on the phone for over an hour and talked to 2 different people and they still can't answer my questions."
2010-11-18 19:26:55,"Rocky Face, GA",Stefani,,"I have been paying three separate Sallie Mae loans for the last two years. They refuse to combine the accounts, so I have three accounts due at separate times a month. I send each payment in a separate envelope, with a piece of paper with the account number, name, etc. When they get the payments, they pay all of the $150 on one account and then start calling me for being late on the other two. I am very very frustrated and they have been no help."
2010-11-18 18:27:22,"Marietta, GA",Stephanie,,"When I attended college, my father took out a student loan through Sallie Mae in order to pay for my education. He said that he would be responsible for paying it if in return I would agree to work during college and help him keep the loan amounts down as much as possible. I kept up my end of the bargain, working three jobs during college, and when I graduated he kept up his end, paying off the students loans in August of 2008, the year I graduated. I thought that was everything, and that I was good to go. I was wrong.In January of 2009, I was contacted by a Sallie Mae representative who was extremely rude and told me that I was overdue on my student loan payments and that if I didn't pay immediately they would note me in default. She said the total amount was $7,000. I was a kid fresh out of college trying to make it on her own. I didn't even have any idea why they would say I owed money, let alone have seven grand to pay. I explained to the lady that I was under the belief that the loans had been paid off, could she tell me why she believed that I owed the money. She couldn't; she just said she saw that. I asked her to provide a proof of my signature, telling her that if I did indeed owe the money, I would pay it off as best I could. She said she would send the request down the line, and I should receive the signature in a couple of days.Six weeks passed, and no signature, but the harassing phone calls started. They were bothering me day and night. Most of the time, I would let it go through to voicemail, but every once in a while I would answer and again demand a proof of signature, and be told the same thing. I could expect to receive it in a couple of days. I never got a copy of that signature.Then, in February of 2010, I started receiving extremely harassing phone calls from a credit company called DCS who explained that Sallie Mae had turned everything over to them, and that I now owed $16,000 as part of the late fees. I explained to them the situation, and they said they would contact Sallie Mae. I can only assume they got the same runaround that I got because they couldn't give me a straight answer for months. Finally in September they were able to provide me a copy of the promissory note, and I was able to (with the help of my wonderful and blessed parents) pay it off. (The promissory note was actually a FAFSA form that every student at my college was required to fill out in order to attend the college. Apparently the college took the loans out in my name is the best we can figure) Again, I thought that was that and good riddance. Now, I recently went to apply for a home loan because I'm ready to move on and start a family. The person who checked my credit informed me that not only is the delinquency on there (which I knew it would be) but apparently Sallie Mae reported the delinquency three separate times: one for each year of the loan. So now I have three major delinquencies on there, denying me the ability to get a home loan, and all because the people at Sallie Mae are rude, inept, and completely without any knowledge of the field they work in and unwilling to help. My credit is shot because of this horrible company. Rest assured, when I have children and they go to college, I will be searching desperately to find an alternative to Sallie Mae."
2010-11-17 03:59:14,"Austin, TX",Dennis,,I paid off my son's student loan 3 months early. I am being hounded 13 months later for no payment. I have faxed proof and sent copies of them cashing my final payment check and they still hound me for the money of the last check. These people have also affected my credit reports and I will battle back and battle back. Sallie Mae is corrupt and need to be corrected! Credit report hurting my refinancing of my house! My credit was 807 and now is 550. Thanks to Sallie Mae!
2010-11-16 18:16:00,"Leesburg, VA",Dennis,,"Unethical ""late fee"" charges appeared on my Sallie Mae account. This has happened to me at least 4 times in the past. It has been difficult for me to prove this issue, but I believe that this time I have a ""screenshot"" that will help in any case. Sallie Mae tends to have discrepancies on account information online, and then ""late fees"" are applied to my account. When reporting this to them with my proof, late fee charges remain. Recently, I logged on their website on 10/15/10 to view my account because my payments are scheduled for the 17th. My payment due date showed 11/17/10 for a total of a little bit over $1000. On 10/20/10, my account showed as being delinquent (3 days) with a $0.00 ""late fee"". It seems like ""Sallie Mae"" did not show a value over $0.00 because the due date actually showed 11/17/10 and did not know how to apply it. I saved that screenshot as proof! I logged back on 11/02/10 and now my account showed a delinquent status of 16 days but with a ""late fee"" charge of $175.00. How does this immediately change? How are they able to charge a ""late fee"" for a due date that posted incorrectly since the first place? They claim that the due date was 10/17/10, however, that did not show. In the past I've also been charged ""late fees"" after submitting my full payment as shown on their website. However, it seems that a new loan kicks in for payment, and since the payment was less, I was charged a late fee. Again, how were the late fees applied if they are the ones that do not show the correct total charge when submitting an online payment? I am interested in any ""class action lawsuit"" to put the pain and suffering in ""Sallie Mae's"" pocket as they consistently do to me as a consumer. Thanks!"
2010-11-15 12:46:54,"Boston, MA",Thomas,,"I pay by autopay from SallieMae's website. I make my payment on time or early to avoid interest charges. Everytime the deduction leave my bank account, there is about a 4 day time frame from the time is applied to my SalliemMae loan. For example, last month the $412.63 cents was deducted from my bank account on a Monday but was not applied to Sallie Mae until Thursday.I incurred an additional $21.46 cents in interest costs. What happens to the money when it leaves my account? Who is earning interest on my money for those 3 days the funds are ""in transition?"" I called our state Attorney General and they are investigating. Who want to incur extra interest when my bank account shows the funds were paid on one date but not applied until three days later."
2010-11-14 22:34:57,"Pearl, MS",Jon,,"I have a student loan with Sallie Mae from the early 90's. The loan was around 8,000.00 dollars. I enrolled to Southern Tech College.

While I was waiting to start school, the school filed bankruptcy.They never refunded me the student loan I was unable to use. My 8,000.00 loan is now 20,000.00. I have tried to contact senators &amp; sent letters to (3) presidents explaining my story. I had to put my education on hold to serve my country. The school accepted all my loan but when they filed bankruptcy, never offered to refund me the money. I feel anytime a school** you when your serving your country someone should work with you. Sallie Mae has denied me a public hearing and has always sent me letters. I feel like they do not want my story to be told and I have heard they have done the same thing to other people in the military.I have been married for 19 years &amp; have 2 children. I feel like my children will suffer from this. I have read other stories by people with loans from Sallie Mae. I feel like they are very sneaky company that has screwed alot of hard working Americans."
2010-11-13 17:43:10,"Palmdale, CA",Yesina,,"My daughter took out a loan from Sallie Mae with me as a co-signer. We took the loan from them with the understanding that she would pay $25 a month while she was going to college and then pay it off when she graduates. When she got to the college, tuition was increased so my daughter had to call Sallie Mae to get an increase on the loan. Sally Mae tried to get some information from me, but I was in the hospital on a Ventilator and was unable to talk. They said that was fine and would go ahead and increase the loan.At no time did they indicate that they would change the terms of the loan altogether. Instead of receiving a bill for $25, in October I received a bill for $69. The letter said that we would pay $69 for two months and then it would double to $139 for 58 months. I called Sally Mae and the gentleman told me that he would look into to the mistake and would call me back. He told me that if I pay the $69 and the rate is $25 a month, I would not get the difference credited so to wait until they get this resolved. I would talk to Sallie Mae everyday for a month trying to get this resolved and each time, they would read the notes and tell me that they are working on resolving the issue.While that is going on, I'm still getting two calls from Sallie Mae everyday saying I'm overdue on my payment. Yesterday (11.12.10), I talked to an account representative named Kiley (not sure of the correct spelling of her name), and she told me that this is the loan that we have and agreed upon in writing (even though all of this was handled over the phone while I was in the hospital), and if we want the terms changed, we have to get the college to return all the money and re apply for a different loan. She rudely told me that if we didn't pay the $69 immediately that we would be in default with the loan and would go to collections. My daughter went to her financial aid office to get their loan returned back to them, but the college wouldn't return the money because it's past the 14 day grace period. We are now stuck with a loan that we can't pay because the monthly payment is too high, and all of this is based on hearsay that we changed the terms of the loan which I know we didn't."
2010-11-12 17:14:37,"Kansas City, MO",Linda,,"The collections department of Sallie Mae referred to as the recovery unit and I made an agreement to pay $50 a month on a private loans. What is important to understand is that I called the collection department of Sallie Mae because I received a phone call from a lawyer's office. I assumed this call was related to student loans. I later found out it was a collections department related to my ex-husband.At present, I understood that the issues with my student loans in the collections department had been resolved and a payment arrangement was agreed upon to keep it from going to the lawyers. It was a fluke that I discovered my loans were sent to lawyers. This agreement was reached because I explained to the Sallie Mae representative that I am making three loan payments for $120 for three months until I am able to consolidate them in three months. There was no agreement that I pay a downpayment or anything to this affect. I have also made an agreement with student loans to pay $340 a month on already consolidated other student loans. I called and spoke with Michael in collection department at 1:15 pm on 11/11/10. I asked him about receiving a phone call from a lawyers office. He then told me that my loans had gone to lawyers dept. I explained to him that I had a payment plan and that those loans should be called back as this was breaking the agreement that I had made with this office. Michael told me that the people I had made the arrangement with were no longer in the office. He gave me a number for Portfolia management * *** *** **** which does not work. I asked to speak to his supervisor. He at first told me that he was the account manager so after several attempts of asking him, he gave me to Max ***. Mr. *** told me that there should not have been any payment arrangement made for $50 on the amount of my loans. He placed me on hold to look at my account. I explained to him what I was doing as far as consolidation that I could not afford to pay anymore than agreed upon. He also mentioned the whole department had been let go. There was an argument that insured in which Mr. *** told me that there was no such payment arrangement. See attached agreement, and credit card account number I made payment too. I told him I was trying to be responsible. Mr. *** reported that I wasn't being responsible and told me to look into the mirror. He made caddy remarks reporting that there was no payment agreement. He yelled at me several times for me to speak with the companies lawyers and hung up. I called back asking to comply with previous arrangement and to give me his lawyers phone number. Mr. *** proceeded to speak slowly that my loans were no longer in his office. This was an extremely stressful call. I asked several times to speak with his supervisor and he refused. I have the credit card number that I had paid the last $50 and an agreement to say when the next $50 is due. I need help from some type of consumer advocates in order to make them comply to our agreement. It has been broken"
2010-11-11 19:43:43,"Monroe, NY",Doris,,"Sallie Mae has been giving me trouble since I graduated. I thought it was mostly me until I read all the other reports on this site and learned that they really are as money hungry and sketchy as they appear to be. I am grateful that I was able to attend and graduate from my college but not at this expense. I admit that I did not really know what I was doing when I signed up at 17 years old and I wish I could be done with Sallie Mae but it looks like I will have to continue dealing with them for a long time. I have to pay both my loans and my parents' loans for my years at school so I make payments twice a month to Sallie Mae. Last year, they suddenly announced that they had sold part of my loan to the Department of Education dividing each into two, making 4 loans that I had to keep track of and pay monthly. Then some months later, they changed the site and said that they were semi-combined again. The Sallie Mae site and phone service is inconsistent and changed so frequently that it is difficult to keep track, get questions answered or find any information. It seems like they deliberately make it complicated and impossible to reach a representative. Last month, when I tried to pay off my loans, their site kept failing and telling me that the information had not gone through. I did not want to be charged late fees so I tried a couple of times but was afraid that the payments were indeed going through and that I was being charged multiple times so I waited a few days and checked. It still had not gone through so I tried again. About 2 weeks later, I tried to use my debit card to pay for something and kept getting an error message. After making sure that it wasn't the actual card that was at fault, I called my bank to see what was up and they told me that I had overdrawn my account. I asked how that was possible because I had recently deposited a paycheck. They checked my history and said I had spent about $1000 dollars on Sallie Mae when my usual payment amount is about $200. Sallie Mae had taken each of the payments that the site had said had not gone through and hadn't even put it through that I had paid them at all. They cleaned out my account and didn't even stop to ask if that was what I wanted or notify that the loan had been paid. But thats not all. I had to go through a several phone representatives before I could find out what happened and then had to have my father call them again because they would not let me make decisions because the loan was under his name even if it was my bank account. He eventually got them to send back the extra money because at that point, I could not even pay for gas or food. After 2 weeks, I still had not received a check and as it was a large sum that I did not want to lose so I called them to ask. After the usual round of pressing numbers and being put on hold for 10 minutes, I reached someone who told me that the check had just been approved and mailed out. I asked if should I need to, they would cancel the check and resend it if it never arrived and the representative said, Yes, you can order a stop payment, if you'd like. The wording of which led me to believe that they would charge me for it. This week, more than a month after the initial over payment, I called again because I still had not received anything and the next loan payment was due and I did not want to give Sallie Mae any more money until I had it back. The first representative after making me repeat back all the personal information told me again that I could not have access to my fathers loan, even though I had all his information. I asked to speak to a manager because I have had it with them and he said sure, put me on hold and then hung up. I called again and the second representative was more cordial and let me access my parent's loan without a problem but then proceeded to tell me that the supervisor who was conveniently not in had not approved of the check and that it had not been sent yet which is directly contradicting the earlier phone call. I told her this and caught her in a lie but she said she was sorry for the misunderstanding but that it was being processed. I asked if I could at least put the payment on hold because I didn't want to give any more money until this was resolved and she said actually until it was cleared, they were taking the loan payments out of the extra amount anyway. This all leads me to believe that they have no intention of giving me any check. They already have their hands on the money and aren't going to give it back and no matter that it was their mistake. I am at least glad that it hasn't been lost into a black hole of cyber space but from what my father has told me, Sallie Mae has pulled similar tricks on him in the past and they later said that these months had not been paid off and charged him again effectively losing him the money. I don't know how to deal with this any further. I really can't believe that this is a legitimate business that people still use. If there was another way, then I would totally go for it, times are hard enough without Sallie Mae."
2010-11-11 00:46:06,"West Warwick, RI",Jillian,,"After paying over the amount that they asked for the next day, I got harassing phone calls asking for more money.  They called me over twenty times a day and now have begun to call family members and people I do not talk to anymore trying to get money.  They found those number from an emergency contact sheet I filled out for school.  Now, I am out of a job that I had for six years and am struggling to find a new job.  I have told them my story a few times and they refused to defer my loans and just keep saying to me that I need to find other people to get the money from.  They have also got very angry at me after I asked a question and the miss I was talking to had hung up on me.  My interest on my loans keeps going up in price and I have no way to stop it."
2010-11-07 04:36:09,"San Francisco, CA",Meghan,,"I will be the first to admit that I should have better understood every inch of that Sallie Mae private student loan when both I and my mother signed it, 6 years ago. I am not one to blame, but our society needs to educate people about debt and loans and everything it entails, especially if it thinks it can run on credit I took out a private student loan 6 years ago to attend a baking and pastry program in San Francisco. I had no credit and the school options were limited. I believe I received a very small grant, and one federal loan, but the majority of the tuition, $24,000, needed to be covered by a private student loan. Well, at least that is what information was offered to us. I was 20 years old and really did not have a clue, so I couldn't even tell you if other options were available at this point.Anyways, my mom wanted to support me. So she co-signed on my loan with the understanding that I would pay it off. When I graduated school, I took advantage of the 6-month grace period and delayed my payments. Then, when re-payment time came around, I found that my payments were nearly $500/month! I was in shock and called Sallie Mae. The nice lady on the phone assured me that I could just defer my payments for 6 months. So I did. And I did again, in the next 6 months as I still could not afford to pay rent, feed and cloth myself, take care of my health and pay $500/month in student loans. This was not including the federal loan payment I had, too. This went on for some time, until Sallie Mae told me, one day, that I had used up all my forbearance and deferment time, and that my loan had doubled. Now my payments were close to $800/month and I had to pay now!With their dazzling customer service representatives, and their even more amazing supervisors, making one want to kill one's self after spending all afternoon trying to ""work something out"" and in the end coming to a conclusion that you, the borrower, are clearly just an unfit person if you can't pay such an insane amount of money. I started ignoring their phone calls. I know, this was stupid. But Sallie Mae has no soul, and it is very difficult to speak to a soulless thing. Trust me. Try it. Or not. Cut to the chase, I wound up finally getting someone last year, 2009, who told me about a new program they had for these difficult times then, after I basically yelled at the poor guy, he very sternly told me that I shouldn't sign up for this program and that my loan would still grow and I would be in the same boat in 6 months. As I did not want to default on a loan my mother had co-signed on, I took the program anyways.It's their 1% interest loan (my loan is close to $63,000 now), and my payments were close to $300/month. Doable, though not ideal by any survival means. So, I was on that and paying monthly, and enjoyed logging on to Sallie Mae's website to see that I was actually paying off my loan! Super slow, sure, but if you see your money chipping away at the mountain, you suddenly feel like a king. Then 6 months rolled around and I waited for Sallie Mae's threatening phone calls once again. They didn't happen. And when I logged on, I saw in the loan re-payment map, my 1% interest payments were to last for some time! I was stoked. I had thought it was just temporary, but it seemed that it was permanent! Then one year after I had signed up for the special program, my mother called to let me know that she received a letter from them saying that I had finished this special re-payment program and my new loan terms would begin in November.So I logged on to my site and tried to find that loan re-payment map I had treasured so often, only to find it missing. Seriously, missing. The re-payment map was no longer there. It was like my loan re-payment did not exist. And now, I just received an email from Sallie Mae letting me know that my payments would now be close to $600/month.The fillers for this story are details of horrible correspondence, multiple bills with different outstanding loan amounts, letters typed from what seemed like a home typewriter, with no letter head, threatening phone calls to both my mother and I, and harassing phone calls reaching the numbers of 20-25 times in one day. In short, Sallie Mae, I'd love to pay my loan off. I would. But you never made an opportunity where I could reasonably do so. You hiked interest up, tossed deferments and forbearance around like candy in the beginning, neglected to educate your borrower about the outcomes of doing this and provided absolutely the worst customer service I have ever encountered. Like I said, I know that I am responsible for this. But it just never made sense to me that you would chose to ** people rather than work with people so that this money is paid back to you.It's almost like you think we're out to ** you! And you've got your hands over your ears, your nose up in the air and your eyes to your very own god who's letting you know that, 'No, no, Sallie Mae. You're not The Devil, no.'"
2010-11-05 15:26:12,"Houston, TX",Sandra,,"We have been paying our Sallie Mae loan each month, adding additional payment to the principal. I received a payment coupon from Sallie Mae, saying that my payment dropped by ten dollars. For the last two months, I have sent slightly more than that amount. Within the last two weeks, I have been subjected to hourly calls from Sallie Mae saying that I owe them $12 and it is 27 days past due.I made the payment electronically and they continued to call. I asked them to stop calling and was told that they were calling my cell as a courtesy to me, so that my credit report was not affected. When I asked if they could stop calling or only call once a week, I was told that the only way that they would stop calling was if I sent a cease and desist notarized letter and they would stop all communication with me. They are calling my cell, my husbands cell, my husbands work and relatives--all for the $12 that I already paid!"
2010-11-02 16:37:47,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",Adesina,,"I have been a Sallie Mae Customer for over a decade. I could not believe the level of harassment I have experienced from this organization who consistently changes my payment terms, interests rates, due dates and then calls hysterically from 8am-9pm. Despite making arrangements, multiple representatives call myself and my cosigners everyday with varying payment due amounts and dates. I have spoken with multiple supervisors about the harassment, inaccurate information provided by their customer service representatives and the fact that I receive approximately 15 letters a month from them with differing information and at best I have been offered a watery apology.Before 24hours are up my phone is ringing again. The last conversation I had with a representative to fix yet another error (they have misapplied so many payments in their favor, I cannot help but believe they are doing it intentionally) and I was told but I quite ignorant representative ""Maybe you should just pay your bill. I don't know what happened but you need to pay some more."" After requesting to speak with her supervisor, I was rudely hung up on. I have read hundreds of consumer complaints all over the web regarding Sallie Mae. How do they continue to be allowed to operate in such rude, illegal, hostile and harassing manner?"
2010-11-02 16:10:21,"Columbia, MD",Kim,,"I happened to make a stupid mistake of co-signing a student loan with Sallie Mae for a relative and ended up having to make payment because that person went bankrupt. Sallie will continue sending the bill to him even though I informed them that I am paying for the loan, and I will only receive late payment and late fee notice. I have requested to have the bill sent to me or at least get an email notification to remind me to pay for it on time to avoid late fees instead of the borrower who is nowhere to be found.However, they refused to do it and give me the excuse that the system is not set up that way. They let me have access to an online account that does not allow me to set automatic debit each month or even schedule the payment ahead of time and tell me that I have to remember to log in every month to pay and there is no other way around it.I am a working mom, and I can't remember every thing; that's why I have a reminder set up for everything and sometimes I can't do it as scheduled because things happen with kids. The customer representative and manager that I talked to were both completely not helpful. I have asked to get the late fee waived until they said they will send me a form in the mail to do automatic debit (they never did the last time I talked to them).I was so fed up with the bad customer service and how their system is set up to get people's money on fees, I ended up paying off the loan that same day so they won't get another dime on interest from me again.Don't borrow from SM, if you do, pay it off asap. These people have no idea how to do business and don't have common sense. I wish I knew more about my rights as the co-signer because I don't believe that it's okay to send the bill to someone else when one is taking over the account and the responsibility to pay for it."
2010-10-28 20:35:21,"Malibu, CA",L.C.R.,,"I am a full time student, and have been for approx. 6 years. At one point my university had a shift in their accreditation, so in order to remain in school I had to seek out a private loan for awhile, that's where Sallie Mae came in.Long story short: since that time 3 years ago, I remain a full time student, although was laid off from my non profit organization position earlier in the year. I contacted S.M. immediately, they sent me an unemployment packet to fill out for relief of payments temporarily, or so I was told. For the next several months, every rep I spoke to told me something different I needed to do, I followed all their direction, only to be told when I would follow up: ""The last rep you spoke to gave you incorrect information. ""Months go by, then suddenly everyone with S.M. is on the same page now and all say my late fees are kicked in and I am now in serious trouble and owe thousands in late fees alone. I have not been able to find work, I had to move out of my apartment, my daughter had to go live with her dad because of my situation. I am going deeper into debt with each month, trying to survive with a babysitting job here or there, it's a nightmare.Sallie Mae offers nothing, refuses the 20 a month I offered to just show good faith or possible stop some of the bleeding with this loan. They are insulting, unprofessional and offer absolutely no options when someone is a product of this state's economy and hits serious hard times.Their rigid, deceptive tactics are a recipe for failure if you ever hit upon a tough time in your life. My credit is now ruined, it's going into collection, my co signer no longer speaks to me (who can blame them) and she is going through a divorce now and having a crisis of her own.So many people in this state and country are suffering in this economy, losing everything. How can a company like this be allowed to continue ruining lives that are already falling apart, it just doesn't seem right to not have any available options for people who have good intentions but are in a temporary financial crisis."
2010-10-27 16:58:08,"Beaver Falls, PA",Bob,,"I am worn out. I don't even want to type this, because I've sung this tired and overplayed song time and again to so many deaf ears. My wife and I have loans for both her and myself. She's out of work, and I found out last week, I'm making 75% of the average starting salary for my career field. We have two kids. I'll fill in the blank even though you already have. We're in over our heads. I defaulted on my Sallie-Mae loans in February. About May, I got a call from the company National Collegiate Trust. For the most part, they have been quite professional. I worked out a deal with a gentleman (he truly is) there, that was hard for me to make, but I could shuffle things around and make it work. The deal eventually worked out to a monthly payment of $250, and after $750 was paid, the interest would be frozen and no longer accrue.Literally days after I made my payment up to a $1000 total, per our agreements, I was called by National Enterprise Systems, demanding the full balance of all loans. They said they had no records of payments. They have harassed my wife, and they have harassed me for two months now. They said they would be willing to settle for $50,000, which is less than half the balance.That is a great offer, if my credit wasn't already trashed over this to the point, I can't get a loan for that amount! My family is already tapped out for other obligations, and I don't know anyone with $50k laying around. I had been working two jobs for a month and a half, and expected to have some money saved up that I could put toward this end, but ended up needing to pay down my electric and gas bills, and to fix problems with my car that I couldn't put off any longer.This guy wanted nothing of it. It is disgusting. I am disgusted that people suggest I should pay my loans first before fixing my broke down car, or before my household necessities. When my brakes are grinding because the pads are worn off, because I haven't been able to afford changing them, it is beyond time to change them. I was actually told, literally, not two hours ago, that if I left my brakes go long enough to get worn down, I can afford to let them go a little longer to make a student loan payment. I'm paraphrasing of course, but I'm not creative enough to make this up! And that just scratches the surface! They would sooner see my house in disrepair, and my car broke down in my driveway, and me out of a job, then come up with a reasonable payment arrangement. Their philosophy is, ""Let's get as much as we can, now."" How is this legally acceptable?! This is unbelievable. And this is just the stuff that I have the patience to type! I have lots of notes. That little box down below that says ""do not"" want an attorney to contact me. You need another that says, ""Please have an attorney contact me!"" Please, please call and email. Anytime day or night, preferably after 9pm, because these loan sharks don't call after then, and I'm more likely to not ignore it. I'm praying to God for a little hope."
2010-10-26 14:38:10,"Columbia, SC",Ondra,,"I returned to a graduate program at Webster University and my payments (which were via EFT) were deferred. I opened my bank account this morning and realized that Sallie Mae had drafted my account for a full payment; thus, I will bounce several auto payments I have set up.I did receive a letter in the mail of the EFT change, but I just received it today. The draft occurred last night. The letter was created on 10/17/10 and the draft was for 10/23/10. I did not receive the 10 days notification that is required by law via the EFT Draft legislation. If I had received it, I would have stopped the payments as I am currently enrolled in school and the status should have been deferred. I will bounce several arranged payments and incur multiple late and bounce fees."

2010-10-25 18:41:12,"Astoria, NY",Sean,,"According to Sallie Mae, I was 2 days late on my new student loan. They started calling my house several times a day and not leaving messages. When I finally spoke with them, they told me I was late and owed them $32.37 2 days. I pay my bills via auto pay from Citibank and hadn't looked at the latest statement where they raised the amount from $32 to $64 (a new disbursement), so I had sent them $32, but had not sent them the additional $32 and that's what they were calling about.I told them I would send a check, but since it hasn't arrived yet they continue to call and this afternoon called during my sons nap and woke him up. How can they call multiple times a week, for a bill that's only a couple days late and only $32? I've paid off all my other loans (undergrad and Business school), in full and have perfect credit. Isn't this what the credit card act was supposed to stop?"
2010-10-21 19:24:05,"Denver, co",Felicia,,"I have a loan that keeps bringing my credit score down. So, I requested all the paperwork for it because it was not mine. They sent me a signature page for a loan application that had been written in after the fact. Information for consolidation on a loan I didn't have.I talked to the fraud department and they could not provide me with the company the loan had been consolidated from. Nor was there any of the typical loan information like financial information. So, I requested that they do an investigation because it was not mine and they refused. I have no idea where this loan came from I wasn't in school and had not had any loans through Sallie Mae or any other organization at that time. More importantly, I was never notified of this loan and it just sat there and collected interest since 1994. My credit score continues to go down every month because the original loan was $4848 and now it's almost $12K. Since this is considered a revolving account when they get past the 45% of the original value it has detrimental consequences to your credt. I need help!"

I chose to go back to school, and I had to get a Temporary Hardship Forbearance. I then received my in school deferments, and I began school, got my loans, financial aid, everything went as planned. Then, 5 months later, Sallie Mae defaulted me, and sold my loan. Mind you, this was in the middle of a semester.When they sold my loan, they did not give my information to the guarantor and now I am in default and I am going to lose my spot in my classes, and as a result will be losing my job and home. Sallie Mae is a company that operates outside the legal system, and I hope that they get all that are coming to them. I sit on the phone with these people for hours every day and not only do they not help, every person I speak to gives me a different answer to my request. The issues that are caused are an inability to complete my education, the inability to work, and due to no financial aid check being homeless."

Sallie Mae has been harassing me for over a year now by calling my cell phone constantly day and night 7 days per week concerning a student loan for an Hispanic individual. I can't even pronounce the individual's name, let alone spell it. I have contacted Sallie Mae on dozens of occasions trying to get them to stop these calls. I owe them nothing nor do I know the individual they are calling my phone for.The representatives that answer their (888)272-5543 number (after several minuets of prompts) just say, ""Okay, we'll remove your number,"" and hang up before you can say anything else. The calls do not stop and have gotten worse. These Sallie Mae representatives know they are harassing the wrong individuals but they don't care. They are not really trying to collect anything. They are just trying to keep a job. By having a number to call every day that is a working number, keeps them dialing and in a job.Their activity is interfering with my health because of my illnesses. I have periods during the day where I must medicate and rest after medications. Needless to say, these calls are interfering with these periods in a massive way. One representative thought it was big fun to call me back all day after I told her my condition which was I was ill and being medicated and to please stop calling as I needed to rest. She laughed stated, I was a liar and that she would call all day long if she liked and proceeded to do just that.If there is anyone reading this that can help, I implore you to do so. Sallie Mae is breaking the law and because they are involved with the government they are being allowed to do as they please to anyone. Even people who have no dealings with them. What private industry corporation would be allowed to do this to people and get away with it? This is the government, so who will stop it? This is wrong, wrong, wrong and I am too ill to fight on my own."
2010-10-14 16:19:02,"San Pedro, CA",Michele,,"I graduated from a well known culinary school a year and a half ago. Since then, I have not been able to land a job. I am currently working two part time jobs and making $15.00 per hour. I am working maybe 20 hours per week and constantly looking for a more secure position. My husband has been unemployed for two years now, and it has been a big struggle to make ends meet.I have $80,000 in student loans, and my payment on that would be well over $1000 monthly. I can't afford to make the payments, so I have been paying $100 every three months for a forbearance. I called them yesterday, to request one, and they transferred me to the collections department. My loan was delinquent by 12 days. The woman I spoke to told me I would have to pay $1359.52 before I could apply for forbearance. I tried to tell her I didn't have that type of money, and she got very angry with me and said, ""You have $64,000 worth of loans! I told her that I knew exactly what I had in loans! I asked to speak to her supervisor, and he wasn't any better. I ended up hanging up on him.I called back and got a woman who was very helpful and granted me forbearance after going over a financial statement with me. She said we need to work on a plan that will allow me to start making the payments.I am so upset by this mess. When I went to school, my husband was working in the computer industry making $3200 per month. I figured I would land a great job when I got out of school, and we could easily make the payments. Who would have known that the job situation would become what it has, with so many jobs lost or outsourced? This situation needs to be addressed by someone with some influence! Innocent people should not be bullied by these lenders. My husband has student loans out as well, and they call two or three times a day regarding his account. Believe me, we would both rather be working and be able to pay back our loans, but with the circumstances being what they are, I feel that this company needs to take a step back and look at the whole situation, and try their best to help instead of hinder.I have extreme emotional distress caused by this company. When I spoke to them yesterday, I was in tears, trying to explain our economic situation to them. Trust me, the job situation is not our doing!"
2010-10-10 17:42:32,"Spokane, WA",Cynthia,,"In addition to endless hours of telephone transfers, lack of customer assistance, and unimaginable frustration in my quest to simply re-pay the loan(s) for my children in college, I have been repeatedly locked out of my online login account with Sallie Mae. When Sallie Mae transferred one of my loans to Department of Education, my original personal information with Sallie Mae, specifically my birth year was contaminated on the original Sallie Mae account making it impossible for me to make a payment online. After 10 phone calls and three faxes, that information was finally corrected.This fall, Sallie Mae announced that there would be a single login account for Both Department of Education and Sallie Mae loans, so I was asked to create a new password, which I did in August. In September, I could not access my account, so with a customer service representative, I was asked to complete a new password and was able to make payments online. October 1st, 2010, once again, I could not access my account. I logged in to the Personal Information page which has not changed in 6 and 60 years and I received a red note that the information was incorrect. Friday, October 8th, I finally connected with customer service and told that my browser, Safari, along with Firefox and most other were incompatible with Sallie Mae's login site and I should be using ""Explorer"". This was after the first representative, a young woman, walked me through the login steps as though she could see a screen as I repeated ad nauseum the steps I know by heart. When she asked me a question about what I was looking at, she confessed to be doing a ""companion login"", just talking me through the steps. I am an educator who daily navigates Power School/Power Teacher online desktop management and grading. I am not an idiot and I have never felt more patronized. The representative then announced that my browser was the cause of my inability to login. Really? The browser I've been using for two years and Firefox, the browser for the other four years? I asked to talk to her supervisor who was ""Tracey""; it was confirmed that it was a browser issue, Safari was not compatible and I would not be able to pay my bill online and on time Friday evening. When I became insistent, emotional, creeping close to frustration hysteria, Tracey said she would allow me to make a telephone call payment without a charge. She returned me to the first representative whom I asked if she was looking at my account. The reply was yes. I asked her to clarify which account and she changed the response to, ""Oh, I'm looking it up."" I asked her to not tell me one more ""telephone"" lies. I finally was able to pay my bills. I just spent some time looking at the complaints posted online and the BBB of PA. Clearly, this incident is typical of how Sallie Mae does business. How does the government and the Department of Education justify doing business publicly with such a firm?"
2010-10-06 06:16:48,"Wildomar, CA",Jennifer,,"My husband and I have a private loan with Sallie Mae. Because of our financial hardship, we were given a reduced interest monthly payment. However, it required us to allow Sallie Mae to directly withdraw the money every month. The second month our payment was scheduled, we were billed twice. None at Sallie Mae could explain why, and it was a nightmare to correct. Sallie Mae finally issued us a refund check exactly one month later. They also told us that our payment for the following month was cancelled.Money is incredibly tight in our home, so we did not argue with this. The payment was skipped as promised, and another payment came out the following month. In spite of the fact that they took out another payment, they started sending collection forms for the month that they cancelled the payment. I was on the phone with them dozens of times over this ""missed payment"" that they cancelled themselves.They sent a request for review to their advocacy department and declined it. I have been harassed by their collections department, told that unless I start making an outrageously high monthly payment, I will have to go to court. They volunteered to give us a month of our our payment. We did not cancel any plans. We want to make our payment, but cannot afford the ridiculous amount they are trying to force us to pay. At this point, court seems like a relief over dealing with their collections. I was belittled, insulted and falsely accused by the representative. I've done nothing but just try to make my payment. But Sallie Mae says I am no longer eligible for the low interest plan because of my ""missed payment."""
2010-10-01 14:50:07,"Houston, TX",Natasha,,"I decided to go back to school to further my education. Not knowing anything about loans or anything of that sort, I fell into the hands of Sallie Mae. My loan advisor poorly informed me and kept telling me not to worry. I made $800 a month to live off of while in school and was also paying for tuition while in school. They presented this ""alternative loan"" to me saying I wont have to pay anymore while in school and not to worry about the interest rate because it won't be high. I am not facing interest rates of 13.25% and my loans have doubled. I now owe close to $50,000 in private student loans owned by Sallie Mae. I try to call to get some options but am offered nothing. I am told time and time again there is nothing they can offer me. I feel as though I am being backed into a wall here. I fear I may never be able to live a normal life as a result of this.I am a single mom of three children. We all know the cost of raising just one kid, so the cost of raising 3 is just high. Not to mention the cost of living and necessities. I am a middle class working mom who makes too much to get government assistance but not enough to cover the outrageous prices of everyday living. I have to pay for daycare to come to work and they take a big chunk of my check leaving me very little to work with. I pay for daycare to come to work and have to work to survive. It makes no sense.When trying to explain all this to Sallie Mae, they completely ignore me and keep saying, ""I am sorry there isn't anything we can offer you."" I feel like I am almost forced to go into default but fear doing that as well. I do not need my wages to garnished but cannot afford to make the payments they are asking me. With high interest rates, I will never be able to pay off these loans. I will forever be in debt. I almost regret getting a higher education due to the financial nightmare that follows. I am also afraid to encourage my children to go further in fear of them falling into the hands of Sallie Mae and the financial nightmare. We need help out here. If I had $50,000, I would gladly pay Sallie Mae so they could leave me alone and I can finally breathe. Maybe then I can finally try to think about owning a house or something of that sort. I can finally move out of the two bedroom apartment I am forced to stay in due to not being able to afford anything else."
2010-09-29 15:28:40,"Decatur, GA",Autumn,,"I was convinced by AIU, Buckhead that I would do great getting a loan from Sallie Mae that I could get that degree that would get me a awesome paying job. So I went ahead thinking, ""Well, if the school says it's a good program surely it is."" Did I mention I was young and stupid then apparently? I was told that my monthly payments would be $300 a month round about. I was fine with that thinking once I get my degree it will be easy to get that awesome paying job. Well, once out of school, that job was not easy to find. I finally got a job where I can survive on. My student loans have been $1200 a month since I got out of school. I was shocked, went into default almost struggling to pay any money I could working more then one job.Every time I made a payment which was coming out of my account automatically, they would disperse the money into the wrong loans. Then I would get late fees and mean calls. Each time, I would have to spend hours each month calling and saying you took the money from my account in the amounts you guys set up. How am I late? This has been happening month after month for like five years now.I get all these late notices where I was supposed to be caught up based upon what the Sallie Mae reps said. But then their system or accounts payable department don't know how to do anything. So I have to call every month to sort this out. I have a hard time talking to the same person twice. They don't keep notes on what each other talk to me about. So I now have about five years worth of notes taken monthly that I have to keep with me and my credit is still bad because of them reporting stuff that is false. And every time I go to show my notes on who I spoke with what they said and when nothing ever gets done. You can't fight them on anything. My credit is horrible because of this company even though they have been taking my money out of my account auto debit for years. Plus I send in extra money each month trying to pay down the loans. I have proof of everything. But no matter who I speak to Sallie Mae is too big to fight apparently. It is sad. I would not recommend anyone use this business if you have a choice. I personally have not had one good thing come from this."
2010-09-27 15:21:09,"Logan, NM",Sherri,,"My son went to school over in Avon Dale AZ. While he was there attending UTI, we had a student loan through Sallie Mae. We were told that payment would not start until after graduation. Well that was not the case, the payments started that month and were not the amount we were told they would be. I have asked several times for Sallie Mae to send me itemized copies of the loans due to the fact I can not account for $8,000.00. They stated we took out for a loan. I want signed copies and would like to know also where the money is going that was taken from a direct deposit."
2010-09-19 18:19:04,"Reno, NV",Robert,,"I am working part-time and have been unable to find full-time work.  Our state has the highest unemployment rate in the nation, but Sallie Mae seems to be oblivious to this and does not want to work with us.  When I demanded to talk to a supervisor, I get the runaround and never talked to anyone.  The customer service people are robotic in that they never listen; they just tell you that you need to pay.  When you complain about not receiving a booklet or record of payments made, they blow you off or say that they sent it to you and imply you must be lying, yet they have difficulties in pulling up the information.  They are forcing me to seek legal counsel because of their caustic ways of dealing with customer.  The government promotes people to go to school and take on these loans and then throw their hands up when they can't find employment which they implied was available - talk about a double standard. Sallie Mae should be removed as a viable lending institution for student loans because, as one of commenting people clearly stated, they are no better than loan sharks.  I got $600 plus payment which I can't make based on my income and this has place economic and emotional stress on my family which in turn had eventually affected my health."
2010-09-15 20:40:59,"Sunbury, NC",Shavonne,,"Sallie Mae started asking for their money after I was out of school for six months. I was in boot camp and then I went to training. I explained that to them; however, they didn't adjust it. So the day I finished taking classes full time, I had to pay Sallie Mae. They have no programs to help people after there forbearance period is over. They threaten to garnish my wages. I ask them what could I do; they told me to borrow money from someone to pay them. I applied for this loan as a 19-year old. I had no idea how this worked when I applied. I guess at 24 years old I am paying for it, almost $500 a month. They are trying to affect my credit score, which is going to make it even harder to find a job. Thank God I dont have children. Guess I might as well get two jobs just to support myself and pay Sallie Mae."
2010-09-15 18:27:05,"Highland, MI",Angela,,"I am disabled and applied for total and permanent disability of my student loan in 2008. I was granted the disability from Texas Guaranteed in 2008 for a portion of my student loan. The remaining balance was sent to the Department of Education. Once they received it, I went on a 3-year deferment. During this 3 years the Department of Education requested an updated Dr. form and said the original had to be sent to Sallie **** and then it would be forwarded to them. I did this in November 2009. Sallie **** never forwarded this form. In December 2009 I had to file bankruptcy when I received my discharge June 2010. At this point, when my discharge was received Sallie **** re-instated my loan even though my 3-year period does not end until June 21, 2011 at which point, my loans would be discharged. I have now spoken to over 20 customer service representatives and 5 supervisors at Sallie **** explaining the mistake that has been made. I have provided them with copies of the Dr's form, their paper work stating I am in deferment until June 2011, and all paper work from the Department of Education. I have provided it six times now. I have been told that it has been received. I have even been told I was never granted my disability. I have been told something different every day. They keep saying they are investigating this and cannot give me a time line. Yet they call every day sometimes 3 times a day. And every time I am on the phone with them for at least 2 hours trying to get them to forward my papers to the Department of Education and begging for them to correct re-instating my loan. I have explained my financial position and the fact that I dont get enough from SSI to barely live on. They will not assist in resolving this issue. They have even told me to stop faxing them because they have enough papers. Also I have found out that during this 3-year period Sallie **** is not to be charging interest on loans which they have been more than happy to do. I even provided that documentation along with statements of the interest and all statements show my next due date of June 21, 2011. I truly need help with getting my paper work to the Department of Education and getting Sallie **** to realize that my loan should not have been re-instated after my bankruptcy when it was on a deferment for total and permanent disability prior."
2010-09-14 14:54:52,"South Amboy, NJ",Audrey,,"I am a cosigner on a student loan, which went into default and with confusion with my own student loans. Sallie Mae failed to send me mail to indicate the co-sign loan was in default. Out of no where, I received a certified mail indicating that my loan was in final default. I immediately call Sallie Mae and speak to several customer service reps and they all informed me it was a mistake because their system showed that I was up-to-date. So as most people do, I believe them! A few weeks later, I get the same certified mail. So, I call again (frustrated of course) and start asking more questions. Such as, if you're telling me everything is up-to-date then why am I still getting these notices. Again ""customer service"" tells me its a mistake. Not to draw the story out but I had to call back three more times before they finally had someone with the intelligence to tell me it was a co-sign loan. Meanwhile, they are hitting my credit! After finally getting someone to help me clarify the situation, she (who I'll leave nameless) told that she would update the system to make sure I get all communication involved with the co-sign loan. She also informed me that I can get a letter indicating that I did not receive proper communication about the loan. Needless to say, she left the company before I got that letter! So when I called back yet again (now over 10 hours of phone calls) to get the letter, they tell me they will submit the request for the letter and it will take up to 7 days to receive it. I called back again to confirm the request was submitted because their customer service is horrible and they say they are going to do things and never do them! And now they are telling me that I can't get this letter! My credit had 6 hard inquiries that would have been handled from the first letter I receive but I got the runaround from customer service who couldn't figure out why I was getting these letters. So now my credit has to suffer for their mistakes. Not fair at all! Sallie Mae is absolutely horrible!"

I went back to college and graduated in 1999 and have been paying them ever since. I still owe Sallie Mae $14K and by the time I'm done paying them. I will have paid over $50K for borrowing just $5,500. They harass me, calling my cell phone 5 times a day, morning through night every single day of the week! I'd rather be dealing with a Mafia Loan shark than these crooks!"
2010-09-09 17:28:06,"Detroit, MI",Kyle,,The call center is in India.  The Indian representative was not helpful at all.  I could barely understand her English and she was rude.  She did not understand that I wanted to pay my loan online but I needed my password reset.  She refused to do this and passed me over to phone payments (another Indian representative).  I waited for 15 minutes between phone transfers that I hung up.  I will have to pay by mail just to prevent finance and late charges from accumulating.

If you could, please return this call as soon as possible as your father, some place in my office for review.  I do want to help and assist you with this.  I have been able to create several options but they do expire throughout the month.  Yes, my name is Nick.  I'm your account manager here from Sallie Mae student loans.  It is in your best interest to return this call back immediately, so I can go over some options, to try to help and assist you with this.  Thank you.""This is one of the many messages I am receiving night and day.  The problem with this is I do not know this person they are calling for.  I have told them on several occasions that Chris B. Junior does not live here and I do not know him.  They don't seem to believe me and at this point, I feel like I am being harassed.  My daughter has a loan through them and has been making payments.  I told them that also.  Is there anything I can do to stop the calls?  They are relentless, calling night and day."
2010-09-08 17:37:57,"Salem, MA",Erin,,"Sallie Mae has lost another check.  At least last time they found it.  This time they did not.  I had to stop the check.  And the person who swore that it was not them who lost it this time also swore that they would leave a note in the system, that if I called back after stopping my check to make a payment, they would waive the fee for making a payment over the phone.  I spent my entire lunch break asking why I am being charged a convenience fee (even after they told me they would not charge me) for them losing my check, for the second time!  I always pay on time, and every other bill gets to its destination on time, except Sallie Mae payments.  So their solution: sign up for automatic payments.  So, they can clean out my bank account and then swear it wasn't them!  If anyone else would like to take my measly $16,000 debt, I would be glad to pay exorbitant interest rates to someone with the courtesy to fess-up when they lose my check, instead of charge me convenience fees for it!"
2010-09-07 18:14:28,"Huntington Beach, CA",Judy,,"This is in regards to a student loan that I purchased approximately $1,995. I paid the loan completely of 7/28/2005 along with other payments made previous to this date. In Nov. 2008, the company sent me payment coupons, which I figured to be a computer glitch. They have sent it into their collections company EdFund, which advised me to file financial hardship and deferments until this matter has been resolved. Now they have put a tax lien through the treasury department and have put this on my credit report. I have expressed many times that this is an error, to no prevail. They are trying to charge me late and interest fees on top of a loan that has already been settled."

However, they continue to contact me on a weekly basis, and tell me my account is in serious trouble, so I contact them, and they apologized, and said it won't happen again, but it continues to keep happening!  This is a real strain on me, emotionally and physically.  Please make them stop the harassment!"
2010-09-03 08:25:30,"Boston, MA",Jose,,"These people do not care about customers. All they care about is money. Sallie Mae is the worst choice for student loans. Their customers support **. When you are talking to their customer representatives, they are always hiding the customers the truth. It won't take them a second to make your life a living hell. I will suggest not to deal with these people, talk to another lender."
2010-09-01 21:06:51,"Chicago, IL",Annie,,"I made two student loans in 1988, and two student loans in 1993.  Sallie Mae is the service provider. I cannot not pay-off the loans, due to servicing issues, like Sallie Mae purchasing loans from banks such as Chase, and replacing the TCF loans. Sallie Mae purchased two loans from Chase in 2005, and now I am being garnished for the loans, because I refused to pay them off. I lost my job in 12/2007. I have a contract position which pay less than unemployment, and now I have a garnishment on my check. I have bad credit, and I am suffering a hardship."
2010-09-01 15:00:49,"Rochester, NY",Annette,,I was late with a payment as I did not receive a payment book and forgot. I sent the payment out with a $20 late fee.

2010-08-31 01:59:32,"Columbus, OH",Michelle,,"I have called service. The customer service people do not speak English, so it is hard to get your point across. I've asked repeatedly that they reset their password and log on to manage the account and make payments. They would not do it unless I pay $50.00 for a forbearance or $14.95 to pay by telephone. Paying on the internet is free to do. They are distorting the American people who want to make payments on their loans. The account is now over 90 days past due. They are destroying my son and the cosigner of the credit to get extra money from borrowers."

Sallie Mae recently split these up, and their link to check the account, only brings up error code 20219.  I am unable to determine the status of the loan. I am also unable to determine monthly payments and due date."
2010-08-29 12:59:47,"Columbia, SC",Vicki,,"From the point of entering into three student loans with Sallie Mae, I had been told that once the loans were in repayment,  if I paid promptly for 24 months that the co-signer could be removed. I spoke to numerous representatives over the repayment period who all confirmed my eligibility, told me the date I was eligible and what steps needed to be completed to have the co-signers removed (a form needed to be completed). When I couldn't find the form on their website, a supervisor mailed it to me after confirming my eligibility, as none of the customer service representatives could find it. As soon as I received the form in June 2010, I completed the request and mailed it back. A week later I received a form letter stating that 'my loan program was ineligible to have the co-signer removed.' I called Sallie Mae and now my account was flagged that my loan program was not eligible and I was told that the loan documents did not specifically state that the co-signer could be removed. I asked how did I even know about the program, the terms, or the form needed had it not been for representatives from the original application and all customer representatives confirming time and time again that I was eligible and the date I could make this request. And how would I know that it needed to state in the loan documents that this program was eligible when the representatives told me it was and the loan documents did not state that it was not eligible either? All of those customer representatives verified over and over my eligibility, the date, and the process, yet now even though there are records that I did call. There is no record of 'why I called' and only now is my account flagged that the program of my loans is ineligible. I consider this blatant misrepresentation and I would have never agreed to adding a co-signer had I not been assured that they could be removed."

I received nothing from them in writing indicating the loan was paid off, even after going through a very frustrating phone call in which they promised to provide paperwork. Also re: my student loan. They underestimated my payment by 25%, I assume to maximize interest. My payment jumped dramatically in the finale year, once they made the extra interest. I guess they don't have access to amortization tables, or maybe they're just a corrupt gov agency. Thanks for reading."
2010-08-23 20:35:05,"Litchfield, CT",Robin,,"I enrolled in Morse School of Business and obtained a Student Loan which was sold to Sallie Mae. The original date of this loan was 1996. I had it in forebearance while in school. I ended up not finishing school because I was sick and hospitalized, during which time the school failed me on all courses. A year later, the school went bankrupt and out of business. (Part of my loan agreement was that I could return to school since it was ""paid."") My problem is with Sallie Mae. I have been paying on this loan forever. The original amount was $14,959.55. I now owe $15,960.91. I do not understand since the paper they just sent me said I have paid $13,938.39 in interest and only $4,111.17 in principal. How is this legal? And they are charging me a rate of 9%! Technically, I have paid this loan off already and yet I still owe them over $15K! I am furious. I did put the loan in forebearance again a few months ago because I have been unemployed since 9/12/09. I paid them as long as I could. I have lost my home which was sold under a short sale and all of my retirement and life savings. I do not understand how this company can get away with this."

Also, did not send a coupon book to me because I am ahead on my payments, and, cut off access to my computer acct! I had to call and request a coupon book (which I was told the request takes 7-10 days) and, made them re-instate my password so I could access my acct! What is this? Who do they think they are? I have already had my acct. audited once - they had to reimburse my account over $200 due to the interest not being figured correctly. That was from 2003 to 2006. The Sallie Mae servicing co. is a rip off. In 2003, I owed $12.000. In 2010, I still owe over $8,000!? I have even paid extra and started sending my payments in earlier to avoid more daily interest."

I ask them if there are any options available to me and they say no and they make threats. One time, I told them I was going to get a lawyer involved and the man said, ""You have money for a lawyer and not your student loans?"" I asked him what his name was and he refused. I am over my head with bills, especially student loans. I am fresh out of college with no good paying job, nor a job in my field which I owe all this money for my degree. Please help me.I am about to default ob my student loans because they are not offering any solution. The money I do try to give only really hits the late fees and high interest rates.As for my mother, her credit is impacted because it states she owes more debt than what she does and that she has loans that she doesn't have. Her credit score number is negatively impacted by these false accusations and ultimately at a number it shouldn't be at and Sallie Mae has done nothing about this."

I reviewed my payment history and found that the payments that I made ahead were applied incorrectly causing the loan to grow bigger instead of being paid off early. I called them and spoke to someone in India that could not help. He claimed that I had been taking forbearance, when in reality what I had done was to pay those payments ahead of time. I made a total of 16 payments ahead of time over the life of the loan.I called them again and was told to file a formal dispute, which I did. The response from Sallie Mae was to send us a payment history and say if there were additional payments, not applied, to contact them. They did not address the issue of how the early payments were applied.I then sent them a certified letter, in which I explained the problem again, but never received a response from them.I have had to pay additional payments adding up to around $1,000.00."

She managed to graduate in December. In February of the next year, she was hospitalized again and at that time she was declared disabled and started receiving SSI. When this loans were taken, we did not know this would happen. She makes 600.00 a month and Sallie Mae wants over $300.00 in student loan payments. My daughter is a disabled mental patient with a brain tumor. We have asked 4 times for the forbearance papers to waive the payments for awhile or at least lower the payments since she is on a fixed income. Their website says this packet is available. Each person says I didn't ask anyone in this department to send the papers then they are never sent. The harassment is unbearable for my daughter. They have called 3 and 4 times a day. The other night she was so upset she asked me to talk to the guy from Sallie Mae. When I asked the caller to send the forbearance paperwork, he said I was just trying to get him to feel sorry for me.

But, I am also getting extremely stressed by all these phone calls from Sallie Mae. Yesterday, I phoned them back and told them to ""take my Social Security check"" - just to get them off my back. They said they cannot unless my loan went into default. So, they are sending me paperwork to fill out for monthly payments. Don't these ""people"" who I can barely understand with their accents, connect with each other? Or can't they 'understand' each other?Since, I thought I was making payment arrangements they would stay off my back. Oh no! they keep coming after you. The government is scary. Please do not get a Sallie Mae loan unless you are already wealthy or have rich parents! I have neither. Plus my degree had not done me any good as I ended up volunteering over the years, more than my work (payment) history, just to get 'noticed' so I could get a paying job. Good Luck to all you youthful dreamers. There are no jobs out there! Especially for an old woman."

2010-08-13 16:31:34,"Denver, CO",Felicia,,"Sallie Mae is reporting my loan origination amount as my limit, so all of my accounts show over the limit from the beginning. I tried to get them to remove the ""Credit Limit"" and they refused. As a result my credit score goes down every month! So anyone who opens a loan with them from that day forward, it reports negatively to your credit. The more interest that's added, the more negative it is to the individual especially if it gets over 50% of the original value."
2010-08-13 00:25:44,"Jacksons Gap, AL",John,,"Concerning Sallie Mae: Back in November of 2009 I had to file Bankruptcy due to divorce. I was told I could not file against Sallie Mae since it was a Student Loan. That was fine, I would make the payments. This Year (May2010) I lost my job. I tried to file a deferment on the payments due to the loss of the job. We went around in a circle telling me I could file for a deferment once all was said and done, I did. Today August 12, 2010 I was contacted by Sallie Mae and was told I could not file a deferment but could only file forbearance.They told me I would have to pay fifty dollars per loan per month with a maximum or $150 a month. I ask if I don't have a job, how do I pay $150 a month? I would be able to make the payment if I could do that. They stated that it is $80 less than the payment so would make it easier. So what can I do if I can't make the payments? I lost my home and everything else, what can they take? Our government, we, bail them out and they want to punish me."
2010-08-07 04:50:22,"Bothell, WA",Joshua,,"I've been out of work for over a year and half and just recently got a job. Today (Aug 6, 2010) I go to work and my manager gives me this letter. I opened it up and read it. It was from Sallie-Mae who is going to take my whole paycheck and on another sheet of paper, it says that if I don't do anything about it, I would have to go to court and deal with it. This upsets me because well, there are no one hiring around here and no jobs are opening and then Sallie Mae wants to do this. Before I moved from SC to WA state, my mother tried to make a payment a long time ago with them but they kept on getting very rude and want the full amount. So my mother said no and then things just got very rude over the phone and she just hung up on them because she will not deal with it. At this moment, my future wife is having problems now with her back so I'm the only one who is working and making house, land, cable, internet, and grocery all by myself on so much. I get paid every week and Sallie Mae (USA Funds) wants to take my paycheck away from me to pay off the 6k plus loan. They need to show some kindness. Yes, my fiancee filed an I&amp;R for the insurance companies but still, it doesn't help to make payments and that's going to be bad just because I don't get many hours. I might only get 10hrs to 12 hours a week. Tell me how you can afford everything when you're off for 4 days and making $8.65 an hr?"
2010-08-03 00:02:47,"Freeport, NY",Dione,,"I took out a private loan with Sallie Mae in September of 2007 for about $20,000. Now at 3 years later, they are telling me if I choose to pay off the loan my pay off is around $37,000. I entered the job market at the height of the economic crash and from the day I stopped working Sallie Mae called my house and cell phone in 5, 10 and 20 minute intervals from early in the morning until after 9 at night.They don't offer a deferment plan for private loans. You have to pay $50 for 3 months. When I was finally able to start paying, it was only because of a rate reduction plan which they refused to originally offer me.I had a customer service rep set me up for payment and when I look in my bank account, they've taken a double payment. First, they tell me that there wasn't a double payment. I had to go to my bank who agreed that there it was as plain as day. Then, I was told that the money wasn't taken out originally because they received a notice from my bank saying there was no such account. I call back a day later and another rep is telling me the funds weren't in the account and were never taken out. Mind you, this entire time there are two payments showing deducted from my account.When I call back again. I'm told to print a copy of my bank statement and send to them so they can see for themselves. I do, fax it over and hear nothing. When I call back to follow up, ironically I speak to the same man who originally set me up in the program. He has no clue what he's talking about and breaks out into a hysterical laughter.Later that evening, I call back after my nerves have calmed down and speak with the first sensible intelligent person there. She reviews everything and admits that they had taken my account/routing number down incorrectly and when the other girl called, saying the bank said, ""Account didn't exist and I gave her my debit card #, she mistakenly entered it twice. She must have tried to cancel the second one, but it had already gone through and my bank was holding the funds to give to them.Meantime, because they thought they had canceled it, they were telling me they never took out the money twice. The intelligent customer service rep admitted she had worked in banking for 20 years before losing her job due to economy and having to come work for Sallie Mae so she understand the whole mix up and was able to get it cleared for me. During that time, I had to borrow money from other people to cover my bills because I had other automatic payments set up for car insurance etc. that were due to come out but Sallie Mae had taken the money. Now thinking all of that was resolved, in June 2010 they took out the payment with no problem. About a week or two afterwards I start receiving calls about how my account is 127 days in default. I tell the lady ""No, you took out a payment just fine."" She checks, says, ""Oh"" and hangs up.On July 2010, I call because I switched my bank card and wanted to update it with them and what do I first see when I log into my account--""Your account is 127 days delinquent."" I ask on the phone whats going on and they say they kicked me out of the program because one of my payments hadn't gone through because the bank account showed non-sufficient funds. I try telling the guy that he's probably looking at the original payment and explain how Sallie Mae messed up and had to fix things and put me back in, and he says, ""Well, I see your last months payment came out fine, so I just have to set you up again to enter the program. Pretty much everything I said went in one ear and out the other. I ask why is it still showing delinquent? He never answered. Additionally, Sallie Mae has been charging me late fees for all of their mistakes.He admits this and says, ""Well, I can talk to my manager, because all of your payments show they were taken before the due date and you shouldn't have the late fees, but since I'm not the manager I can't tell you anything. Why is it even up for debate? Why am I having to wait and see if Sallie Mae is willing to remove late fees that occurred while their trainees were making mistakes with my account and it is all documented?Icing on the cake. I ask if I'm going to have to go through this each time I attempt to make my payment (which he never answers) and I question if I'll have to go through the 6 month/3 month trial period and he says, ""Yes, but the good news is we're letting you back in"" (although they never should have taken me out) ""The only difference is, You'll just have to wait for us to update your credit report."" So while they are playing games with my account and making me pretty much sign up for the same program each month, my credit report is looking as though I'm not making any payments and is showing delinquent, and although technically my 3 month trial period is over, because they keep knocking me out the program and re-entering me, each month is as though I'm starting new in my 1st month as a delinquent account holder."
2010-07-30 17:35:42,"Bala Cynwyd, PA",David,,"My daughter applied for a SallieMae student loan several weeks ago. I was the co-signer. Her application was accepted and her school notified that money would be forthcoming. Then the fun started. Weeks after acceptance and notification, we received a second notice that we must sign a revised agreement. The notice did not say why the agreement was revised (complaint 1). I called to find out and was told that the school changed my daughter's status from full-time to half-time. We called the school and were told no such thing occurred (complaint 2). I called Sallie Mae again to let them know about their error and was transferred to an office handling applications. The recording on the phone said that the office was closed; that it is open only from 8 am EST. It was 9 am (complaint 3). SallieMae is incredibly incompetent."
2010-07-30 13:33:00,"Bluffton, SC",Sharon,,"For the past year, Sallie Mae has been saying that I have not been paying my payments. I have to constantly send in copies of my bank statement (the statements are actually my son's checking account as he pays the bill) showing where the payments have been made and never posted to the account. After about a month, they fixed the problem until the next month when it starts all over again. I have had this account since 2003 and never had any problems until 2009. They charge me late fees and contact the credit bureau stating that I do not pay these bills."
2010-07-28 02:30:20,"Southfield, MI",Eric,,"In September of 2009, apparently, Sallie Mae sold off several of my student loans to the Department of Education without notifying me. Recently, they started calling me stating that I was past due, even though whenever I log into their site, my loans are current. Apparently, I had to create another log-in and then I could see these loans, totaling $11/month. They could have sent me a letter."
2010-07-27 21:42:08,"Georgetown , tx",Kamalir,,"I returned to school as single mother of 3 boys, trying to better our lives, and leave dangerous situations behind us. I got a Tuition Answer loan from Sallie Mae to help cover the difference in school costs and living expenses while I was in school. After I graduated, I was unable to find work and still am unemployed. I received the paperwork for my loans via USPS mail forwarding. I contacted Sallie Mae concerning my loan and explain my situation and spoke to so called supervisor named Lucifer which refused to give me his full name and even spell it and hanged up on me because I was still asking him question about my deferment or forbearance options.His last words was call us back when you have better income to pay for the loans than he hanged up leaving me hanging on the phone. He was not pleased because I kept asking him about my loans and the options since they already said I was behind on payment. They wouldn't even lower down the payment because I didn't have the proper income to accommodate the payment so they didn't submit my payment request. They prefer that you are behind and that it affects your credit. I think that's why a lot of student don't even bother calling them or make payment arrangement because they give you the run around and makes it so impossible so that you get frustrated dealing with them and let it go diligent. I even send them paperwork that I was below the poverty income and was receiving food stamp and rent assistance. They still refused to help even after showing to them proof of my circumstances.For three months, they sent out mailings, saying that they had no information for me, but they were calling me multiple times a day and talking to me the whole time and verifying the information about me the whole time. I even explain to them that I had to disconnect my phone because I couldn't pay for it. The worse part, the letters that they sent out, had my correct mailing address on them and notified them of every change.And when I complained to Sallie Mae about what happened, the representative told me that if I had just gotten a job and paid my bills, that wouldn't have happened. I didn't have any opportunity to come up with the deferment fee, which only last a few months. Now they are calling again, and can't understand why I can't find work, or pay over $500.00 a month. I'm willing to do anything for work, and they can't even do what they are paid to do.If I were able to add up all the time I spent on the phone dealing with their poor excuse for representatives, there are not here to help students with their education loans their only here to make it more and more difficult for student to even borrow money from them. This will be the first and last time I borrow any money from Sallie Mae. They really need to re-think their mission statement of helping student because they don't do nothing just make it worst on the student that even tries to make any kind of payment arrangement with them. Time that would have been better spent searching for a job, advancing my skills, or spending time with my special needs children which I have 2 of them. I wouldn't recommend Sallie Mae to any student what's so ever they need to make better ways to help student then what they say they do.They should not be in business providing loans to students because the really not here to help student with their educational needs they here to suck you dried and don't even care if you are about to be homeless they are only worry about their payment that you owe them. I can understand if I am lying about my circumstances but I did provide them my resources and that I was below the poverty line because I send them letters of my food stamp. They should not be in business especially there are a lot of student that are just beginning their first year in college and really don't know what they are getting themselves into. I believe that the committee that reviews these complain sure take us more serious and do something about this company so another future student don't have to go through the circumstances that I am going through with them."
2010-07-26 22:19:16,"Cincinnati, OH",Tim,,"I am an adult first year college student dealing with Sallie Mae. I had an old student loan I was paying on from them several years ago. I also now have the first year disbursements behind me. They have suddenly started calling me demanding that I sign a forbearance agreement for past due payments for loans that I put into deferment last summer when I decided to return to school. This is the whole catch. If I sign a forbearance for the past 11 months then they get to recapitalize the interest and stick it to me on the back end of the loan. This is all money that (according to their own agreement) is supposed to be in a four year deferment while I am in school. They call me about every two months to try to ""Help"" me by telling me that I need to sign a forbearance. Everytime I tell them to get their crap together and then they go away for another two months. I can easily see how our kids are getting totally ripped off by this company. I am older and understand finance enough to know what they are doing can't possibly be legal. I will be contacting my financial aid office this fall to see if I can switch to a different lender. They are definitely a ""buyers beware"" company!"
2010-07-26 20:12:42,"Whitestone , NY",Demetra,,Sallie Mae discharged my loans when I filed for bankruptcy and is not claiming my co-signor owes them.  They are dischargeable in NYC and have requested several times after my discharge that they be transferred over.  This caused extreme stress and emotional distress!
2010-07-25 12:59:45,"Cambridge, OH",Amy,,"I have loans thru Sallie Mae. I just found out about 3 months ago that they sold half of my loan without ever telling me. When I called the new loan place, they said they were putting it in default for never paying but my loans were all in deferment with Sallie Mae. When I tried to defer my loan with the new company, they sold my loan to another company. When I found out about them selling my loans again, I was never notified in anyway that it was being sold again. The new place said they didnt have my information yet and to call back later that week.  I called every 3 days for 3 weeks each time being told that they didnt have my information yet. Finally, I got a hold of them and they said they sent my loan to another place. When I called them, they said it was in default for my not paying on it in the last 3 months. How can these people get away with this kind of stuff. Im trying to pay them back and they just want to put me in default. Help!"
2010-07-24 17:57:33,"Milwaukee, WI",Rachel,,"My boyfriend wanted to attend an IT (computers) school. The only loan company they dealt with for students was Sallie Mae. He signed up, and needed me for a co-signer. Even before he graduated, he started making little payments, just to get ahead. Then once he graduated, his payment was $300.00 a month. Fine, he was paying it just fine, never missed payments.This past March, he got laid-off from his job. So we started making partial payments. Well it's been 7 months now and our savings is used up and he still is unable to find work. So he called to see if we could send $50 a month. The little rude jerk on the end had the nerve to ask why my boyfriend wasn't working, then took it so far as to say, ""You probably got fired for misconduct. "" Really? Is that appropriate? Then I called the following day to see if he qualifies for a forbearance. They said no, because his account is behind. Well, hello, we know that, that is why we want to do a forbearance.Then this little witch actually said to me that I should go out and get a part-time job. She said, ""Can't you go out and babysit or something?"". Really, who do these people think they are? If it is a choice between rent and food, and making the full payment on my loan, what do they think we are going to do? They call both of our phone between 2 and 3 times a day, including Sundays.It's not like I am saying ""Forget you, I am not paying at all"". I just want the payment lowered until we get back on our feet. The way those so-called customer service reps speak to people is deplorable. I am glad to see people are putting their complaints online. And I encourage anyone who is having problems with those heartless people to file complaints with anyone who will listen, including your congressmen/women."
2010-07-23 22:59:49,"Chester, NH",Barbara,,"I cosigned a loan for a student. I am to pay back such an enormous amount two weeks after the student had the amount applied to his tuition. The interest was enormous after only two weeks. Why on earth is this ""group"" still in business? I am sure I am not the only one who thought this was an aid for students like Fannie Mae. This seems to be fraud at its very best."
2010-07-22 00:58:07,"Spring Hill, FL",Abraham,,"I became disabled and couldn't pay my loans.  They reported me to the collection agency and they harassed me so badly that I refused to talk to them.  The collection agent arranged a one-time payment of $167 and I was able to come up with by selling some personal property on Thursday.  The very next Friday, he called me demanding more money.  And when I told them that I refuse to talk to them because of the way they were treating me, they threatened me with garnishment.  Later, I found out that its illegal for them to do that.  Then, this one girl lied and told me that if I make a payment of $167 a month, it will go towards both loans. One month later, they called me denying the original offer, telling me that I have to make another 100 a month payment.  I asked them why did they lie, and they said they don't know.  And that if I didn't make a payment they'll force me to pay.  That's $267 now total that I have to pay.  She also lied and said that my account would be marked as current, but they left it as delinquent, and I incurred more charges.  I don't think that is legal is it?  Let me know.  I've been forced to make payments several times a month. And they are charging me late charges and interest that shouldn't have been taken."
2010-07-20 17:12:41,"Wrightstown, WI",Tom,,"After graduating from college, I received a letter telling me that my student loans would begin repayment soon. The next correspondence that I had with Sallie Mae was that my payment was overdue with no bill that came telling me a due date for my first payment. I paid my first two payments at the same time and yet again I get no bill or correspondence to make me aware of the next due date and amount. Sallie Mae has since called me multiple times (2-3x a day) and when talking to them and asking them to send me a bill, I get the response ""Bills are sent out to convenience you"". Then I also get the response ""I will mark down that you are unwilling to pay"". Which I am not unwilling to pay. I am willing to pay, I just want a bill to come to me that says I owe X amount by Y date. As a result, Sallie Mae charges me late fees and expects me to make large payments over $500 without receiving a bill notice."
2010-07-16 18:20:17,"Plover, WI",Charity,,"I have almost $200,000 in loans with Sallie Mae. Only my small private loan is in repayment. Yet they constantly apply my payment to the whole thing, then my private loan gets late fees, then I have to call and get it fixed. It happens every month since November. I've talked to supervisors to see what I can do to fix this. I've followed through with their suggestions, yet they continue to ** it up. I called and got it fixed again today. It never fails."
2010-07-15 15:26:37,"Charlotte, NC",Tonya,,"I obtained a medical consolidation loan from Sallie Mae while finishing my medical residency training. According to guidelines set forth by the lender, I was able to defer all loan payments while in training. Very excited having completed training in 2006, I started my first job and was eager and excited to pay back my student loans. I began paying my loans off on time and at a rapid rate. So rapid that I was paid ahead by over a year. Around the summer of 2009, I received notice that I was paid ahead and my next payment was not due until 9/2011. I thought that I should take advantage of this and continue to make monthly payments to lower my principal and overall amount that I would pay back.After paying on this loan for four years, I decided to check on my loan status in an attempt to pay off the loan in full. After researching my principal balance, it seemed strange that I had not made much of a dent in my loan. That prompted me to call customer service where I was informed that in 2006 I had been enrolled in an interest only payment plan. I have never enrolled and would never enroll in such a predatory repayment plan. I felt very betrayed and hurt by Sallie Mae as a company and felt that this was purposefully done to receive additional funds from me. I consider myself responsible and grateful for the medical education that I was able to obtain with the assistance of the loans and wanted to pay them back as soon as possible. I feel taken advantage of and have submitted a request that they change my interest only payment option to a conventional payment option which they have done. I have also submitted a request that they apply all past payments to a conventional payment plan and recalculate my principal owed so that I can pay this loan off and be done with Sallie Mae, that request is still pending. I am very discouraged and disappointed with my attempt to do the right thing and repay my loans on time and ahead of time."
2010-07-13 20:27:14,"Cliton, MD",Tak,,"Sallie Mae is supposed to promote education. But it promotes illiteracy by employing illiterate people who do not have the foggiest what they are doing. I applied for a student loan and they dispersed it for 2009. But they decided to cancel the 2010 loan because they did not have my ID. What happened to the one I gave them for 2009? Anyways, after making a hundred calls to them, they still refused to do any thing about it. But they offered me SMART loan. I researched it and it is actually a damn stupid loan. Why? Because they will charge you interest while you are a student. They want a piece of your flesh. Are you not a wild shark? I am glad the Federal government finally held them by the neck and threw them in the ocean so that they do not do this any more. I just wish them bankruptcy!"
2010-07-10 19:23:22,"Ludowici, GA",Debra,,"I, as a parent, allowed a credit check/loan approval to be ran on me so that my daughter could attend the college of her choice. When, a few months later, I received an offer of a loan from Sallie Mae, I turned it down. I signed the paperwork rejecting it and returned that to them within the stipulated time frame. I started receiving bills and my daughter went to her financial aid advisor at the college with them. He told her it was a mistake on Sallie Mae's part and that our paperwork denying the loan had been submitted - not to pay any attention to the bill. The bills continued to come, she went to the advisor again. He double checked the paperwork, assured us that our end was in order and once again, told us to disregard the bills. I then started getting phone calls from Sallie Mae. The financial aid department at my daughter's former college seems to have undergone a complete overhaul and the old advisor is no longer there. No one seems to be able to help us. This has gone on for approximately two years, during which time my credit rating has been ruined by Sallie Mae. I no longer answer the phone when they call because they refused to believe that the consumer could be right and tried to back me into a corner regarding payments on a loan that I refused to take. I don't know of anyplace to turn. Unfortunately, I did not copy the loan refusal before sending it. They have contacted friends from my church as well as family members all over the states, trying to track me down. I have also been told that they can garnish my bank account. My husband left our family, didn't pay what he owed to me and the six children I was left to raise. That has gone through courts and we have enough to live on now, but not if Sallie Mae can actually take from my bank account what they feel I owe them. Is there any recourse?"
2010-07-07 19:17:29,"Anniston, AL",Todd,,"I have asked several Sallie Mae representatives to send me a copy of the contract I signed and they won't.

I'm losing upwards of $26,000!"
2010-07-07 14:55:39,"Arverne, NY",Heather,,"I am attempting to obtain any assistance with fighting Sallie Mae Financial. I took out a student loan via Sallie Mae in 2002. The loan was for a sum of 16k plus dollars. By the year of 2004 the loan was paid to the tune of 18k inclusive of the accrued interest. At this time and as per Sallie Mae, the 18k was the full loan pay off amount without prepayment penalties, which is something they claim not to have. The check was executed via the company GMAC and sent directly to Sallie Mae financial. GMAC did not take my father's word for the pay off amount; they confirmed it by contacting Sallie Mae directly and it wasn't until that the check executed.As per Sallie Mae the pay off amount until 7/6/10 will now be 4k and change and if beyond, then the pay off will be 6k and change. I recently have been harassed via telephone and mail with threats of placing negatives on my credit and possibly my Dad who co-signed and later requested the pay off via GMAC. They claim I am 52 weeks late on a debt that I never incurred. I have paid off the loan 6 years ago and they are now trying to collect on additional interest they claimed should have been attached at the time of pay off. Is there a statute of limitations on something such as this? Or any options for me/us at all? I have seen numerous negatives about this company online and most say that this company is very difficult to fight. Sallie Mae has since placed an outstanding debt on my and my father's credit. I have disputed this relentlessly and each time it comes back as valid and confirmed. As per Sallie Mae there was yet another 1k and change that was owed following the loan payoff that I am still accountable for. The meter has been running from 2004 according to them and has reached 2k and change. I am a mother of 3 newly separated with no extrinsic financial help to pay this debt beyond my salary which is already accounted for. There is now a phony debt on my and my father's credit, how can this be allowed? We are being harassed with constant attempts to collect. I managed to scrape up a payment to send to stop the harassment but it will never end until this is made to go away."
2010-07-06 17:19:10,"Chicago, IL",Courtney,,"I've reached out to Sallie Mae and no one seems to care that I am being hit with a balance that is $1672 higher on my outstanding balance than I owe. Maybe emailing all of you guys will get through to someone before I start contacting every media outlet and anyone who will listen about what a scam this company is. Let's break down the math to make things really simple.How is it that my total amount standing, when every payment of interest only + additional money towards principal has been made, and my total amount standing is still higher than my Outstanding Principal Balance even after $1672 has been paid towards principal (again, according to your records) and supposedly applied to the principal balance plus all interest every month has been paid too? Where on earth did these numbers came from? So not only am I paying more in interest each month than I should be, but magically, there is almost $2000 in additional charges on an account that is not delinquent; does not have late fees, has all interest paid plus some each month and every month since my loans went into repayment.In addition to my actual balance being corrected, all of that extra money I put forth towards ""interest"" each month that actually should have been going to the principal balance should also be corrected. I found a number of their VP's email addresses on the web and emailed them. I've sent in two requests to be contacted with an explanation to no avail."
2010-06-24 20:46:04,"San Antonio, TX",Sharmane,,"I took out a loan of $6,000.00 in mid-2005 from Sallie Mae with an interest amount of $1,012.02, making the total amount to pay back $7,429.13. I deferred my payments for almost a year and making some minimum payments along the way. I started making minimum payments on Dec 2006 of $61.00 and now, they are $112.00. My outstanding balance is $6,028.37. I have paid $2,930.00 into the loan. I don't understand how or why my balance is not decreasing? I have been paying for 3-4 years, that is terrible. Any bill is a hardship, but I took out this loan to further my education and it has not helped in any way. It is just adding to my debt and seems to be a money pit with no end."
2010-06-21 17:28:39,"Winthrop, MA",Alicemarie,,I have been unemployed in Massachusetts and I private loans with Sallie Mae.  I paid $95.00 forbearance and the customer service representatives that I talked to told me that my loan would be on hold and not to worry about my loans.  I called on 6/21/10 and I spoke to a customer service representative and supervisor.  Both of them wanted money I do not have and I cannot make it appear out of the air.  I thought Sallie Mae was taking in consideration that people are still not working.  Sallie Mae would be treating people better.
2010-06-21 00:13:56,"Greeley, CO",K.E.,,"Like so many students, you sign the financial aid papers not really understanding them,but expecting no issue because you've been told ""getting an education is the most important thing you can do. You want a good job, then go to school"". Well I'm an attorney graduating from a no-name school, but with big time school debt. I thought passing a bar exam would suffice to demonstrate to employers that even though I did not come from a top school, I still knew my stuff. I was wrong. Now I find myself strangely unemployable. Even with a couple years of practice under my belt, I could not get hired for a human resource job with Uncle Sam. I didn't even get an interview as they stated that I was not a priority. Needless to say, Sallie Mae is knocking hard. I have been paying out $150.00/3 months to keep the sharks at bay while I have been trying to find employment. I spoke to Andrew who said, ""it's not our fault that you have indebted yourself with a mortgage, car etc."". To which I explained how my debt is so huge over, $126,000.00, that there is no house and the one car I owned (which had no bells or whistles not even automatic windows) was destroyed in a tornado in 2008. I also mentioned that while I was employed as an attorney, they had no problem taking $1000.00 a month.Also, while I was employed as an attorney, my starting salary was $35,000.00. By the time I left, I was making $65,000.00. I had to leave my job so that my husband and I could file for bankruptcy because we could not afford rent for a one bedroom apartment, pay our students loans (because he, too, is an attorney starting salary $32,000), our credit cards (that we used to supplement while in law school) and eat. I have applied and applied to all types of jobs, nothing is turning up. If Sallie Mae dings my credit, I will throw the towel in for good because employers (especially Uncle Sam) won't consider delinquent loan holders for employment.I spoke to Sallie Mae about some lower payment plan, the best I could get was to pay interest on one loan a month alternating each loan and that would somehow keep it from going delinquent, but it would also never allow the debt to go down as each month I would accrue late fee (by the way, Andrew did not disclose that latter fact). I grew up in part in a trailer, I believed if I did things right, worked hard, I could have a better life. My advice to people with children in my lower socio-economic bracket, tell your children they are great as they are. Go to the library, don't go into debt over education. Oh and by the way, has anyone mentioned that all our student loans are insured and that once you don't pay/are found delinquent, they get to cash in as well as go after you, the debtor, and basically collect twice on the debt?"
2010-06-17 19:52:19,"Florissant, MO",Catherine,,"I have been receiving calls the past few years. I graduated in May 2007 and still have been unable to find a job in the field I went to school for. I have been working minimum-wage jobs for as long as I can remember. Today, I got a call from a young rep from this lovely company. I told him I am unemployed and seeking new employment. But unfortunately, the job market isn't what it used to be. I am trying to keep a roof over my head, which is getting harder since I don't qualify for unemployment in my state right now. He proceeded to tell me that it's obvious that I don't care about my bills or I would already have a job. I have only been out of work for 2 weeks, and my savings has been spent on rent and utilities. I no longer have my car (haven't for 2 years), because I can't afford one. Sallie Mae preys on the less privileged, and now, I owe almost double than what was loaned originally. I didn't have a college fund; my parents didn't save for me like they did for my sisters and brother. I have been on my own, and now, I don't know what else to do."
2010-06-16 23:30:30,"Sacramento, CA",David,,Lost job. I mailed Sallie Mae and executed economic hardship deferment form to stop automatic student loan payments from being taken out of my bank account. Sallie Mae received my form but went ahead and took $717.59 out of my bank account two days after receiving the form. They told me it takes them 14 days to process the form. Sallie Mae is a greedy company that is all about making money at anybody's expense. They stole my money.
2010-06-15 13:46:22,"San Diego, CA",Hannah,,"This company takes advantage of poor students who are trying to get ahead in life. I am in my medical residency with over $125,000 loan burden and struggling financially. Every single year, I have to file for economic hardship forbearance. I mailed in my W2 form, my bank statements, and my student loan statements to show that I cannot afford to make my monthly payments. The customer services agents on the other end of the phone were completely incompetent. They are located in India or other parts of the world, and they are telemarketers. They read off a script and were completely useless in terms of helping you or giving you information. They hardly speak English and never have correct information. They can never find the application or documents that I've mailed in. I've called every 2-3 weeks to see if my application for forbearance is processed, and I speak with some person who is clueless. And they give me some new excuse or some new paperwork that I need to fill out. Meanwhile, the interest on my loans continues to capitalize."
2010-06-11 20:43:49,"Vancouver, BC",Charles,,"I was laid off from my job in February and, at the same time, went on disability for a degenerative back condition. I filled out a deferment form online immediately. A few months later, I called Sallie Mae. They said they never received the form. I asked again for a form to fill out. They sent the wrong form. I then asked them to change my account from online only to billing by mail, as my online account was proving useless. I never received a bill by mail. Months later, this week, I called. They had an address for me that was 5 years old! I had moved twice and had changed the address with them in writing both times. I called back this week and asked to speak to a supervisor. None was available. I asked them to have one call me (at the same time I asked them to have Sallie Mae stop calling daily for collections). The phone rang just now and it was another Sallie Mae collections person. He was so pushy; I ended up using foul language and hanging up on him. I wish this nightmare would stop. All I want is for my billing to come in the mail. Is that too much to ask? I am really trying to focus on my recovery and can't get up to answer the phone every time they call, sometimes several times a day."
2010-06-09 22:07:24,"Ogdensburg, NY",Cassandra,,"I graduated from college a little over 2 years ago. After graduating, I had a job but had to move. Since then, I've been barely making it by. There are no jobs in many places. So I was able to pay Sallie Mae four forbearance fees, but then those ran out. They then asked me for $900 a month! I have a job as a substitute teacher and I make less than $800 a month. I tell them and of course, they don't care. They tell me I can pay interest only, but that is $600/month. How do they expect anyone to live with $200 in their pockets? Impossible. They call me for months, never leaving messages from various numbers multiple times a day. Clearly, that is harassment. So today, I got a letter stating I am going into default as of 07/01/2010 for the amount of over $86,000. The school year is ending so I will have no job this summer. There are many times where I regret going to college because of this. I was 20/21 when I started this mess and I didn't know any better. My college told me I would have to leave if I didn't get the loan from Sallie Mae so what was I to do? I would love to make payments but I simply cannot. It's simply sickening that an American company is allowed to treat people like this. It also disgusts me that anyone can go crazy with credit cards and file for bankruptcy and it's all cleared away, but I'm a good person. I work hard but I don't have parents to help me."
2010-06-09 20:09:19,"Altoona, PA",Jewel,,"Sallie Mae is terrible, all of the agents with whom I spoke told me that they did not have a designated customer service branch. Well, I checked the BBB website, and yes, Sallie Mae does have a Customer Advocate Unit. I suggest that you get all of your ducks in a row before you call them: 1. get a Sallie Mae agent number for everyone with whom you speak, 2. document each conversation and the outcome of the conversation noting the agent # who gave you the information, 3. Send the Customer Advocate Unit a detailed letter outlining this documentation and your concerns, 4. Make sure you send the letter directly to Kelly ** with, and this part is crucial, USPS restricted delivery mail (this ensures Kelly ** receives and signs for your letter--and you receive documentation from the US Postal Service). Also, I think it may be a criminal offense if Sallie Mae declines your letter.I have been struggling with Sallie Mae for three months and this is the only course of action that works. Yes, it is time consuming, but I am convinced it is one of the only ways to resolve your issues unless you seek help from an outside source. If this doesn't work, fortunately my sister-in-law is a corporate lawyer!"
2010-06-09 19:14:34,"Woodbridge, VA",Beth,,"On April 28, I scheduled a payment as I normally do for online billing. On May 3rd, I opened a new bank account. I went on the Sallie Mae site and updated my bank account information, hit update. Well to my surprise, they still deducted from my old bank account which caused me a 35 dollar overdraft fee. The system did not ask if you want to delete an account and add a new. A warning message did not pop up saying something like ""can not update, payment pending"". Nothing. When I called, they confirmed my change on account however because a payment was pending on the old account, it took from the old. Again, there were no warnings to this and again, no notifications. Their website doesn't even show you what account is on file. I simply asked for my 35 dollars back and they refused. Oh yeah, there is no policy letting you know of this either."
2010-06-09 18:48:05,"Honolulu, HI",Arthur,,"I made a private loan in 2007 for $16,800 with a repayment schedule of $170/month that will total about $31,0000. My balance is $14,000. I requested for a new term of 36 month which would bring my payment up to $421. The interest would 5.25 daily! It wasn't clear to me when I made this loan that the term would be as such. I already paid about $4,000 in interest. I never thought such term like this existed. I think this is unethical and unfair. What can I do?"
2010-06-05 22:34:57,"Riverview, FL",Gabrielle,,"I have had loans with Sallie Mae for college for several years now and I have never seen such complete incompetence. While I was not in school and was having financial problems I put my loans in forbearance with no problem but as soon as I went back to college, this past January, it has been a nightmare. I applied for in-school deferment and one day I get a letter saying that the deferment has been granted; the next day I get a letter saying they cannot grant the deferment because they need more information. This has gone on since January and within a weeks time I have received 6 letters that completely contradict themselves. So I don't know if my loan is in deferment or not. I have tried calling and can never get anyone who speaks English and knows what they are talking about what so ever. I cannot believe that a company as large as Sallie Mae is run so poorly. This had been a huge stress on me and my family because we cannot afford payments right now and now I'm not sure if I can continue school or not."
2010-06-05 17:14:43,"Battle Creek, MI",Denise,,"We were told that the first year my son went out of state to college that I had to take the student loan out in my name. Then after my son graduates that we could consolidate all his loans into one. Now that he graduated Sallie Mae has changed their minds and said no. That I was responsible and that he could not consolidate all the loans into one because some were subsidized, some were direct loans. All of this I do not understand. My credit has gone down the tubes. I am getting my wages garnished and I am about to lose my house and everything else I own because I cannot afford this loan. I never could. But they kept saying that we would have to pay until my son was out of school for 6 months and then it would be turned over to his loans and consolidated into one. This has not happen with him and they want $700.00 a month. He hasn't got a job in his field and is working retail just to make ends meet. So now what do we do?!"
2010-06-04 22:56:29,"Webster, MA",Denise,,"I recently found out that my son's college loan has my name listed as the co-signer. At the time I was being treated for stage 3 colon cancer and out of work, and stated to my son I wouldn't be able to be his co-signer. So I called the nasty representatives and demanded they send me the signature page. The next day, the fraud department spoke to me, and they didn't have my ""written"" signature or my social security number. I had to give them this info to put into their system. The representative confirmed that the signature had been forged... electronically forged! He continued to tell me an electronically forged signature is legal and has been for ten years. This is insanity! How can this be legitimate? They are supposed to be sending me a fraud packet. I'm gonna lose time from work to file police reports and get things notarized. In any case, besides the blame I place on my son, I hold Sallie Mae responsible for allowing him to acquire this loan. Is there anything further that can be done?"
2010-06-01 13:00:29,"Boston, NY",Abbey,,"I pay them on time every month. I have 5 different loan numbers with them. They always misapply my payments. They only apply my payment to one of my five loan numbers so it always looks like the other four are behind. I asked them how to avoid this situation. I was told to send e-mails explaining my payments.Despite me taking my precious time to do this, they still apply the full payment to one of the five loans. I'm paying late charges on other loans that should not appear to be late. I've tried numerous times to resolve this with them. I've given them a breakdown of how every payment I ever made should have been applied. It doesn't make a difference. Nothing ever gets done about it. I just had a representative call minutes ago and she hung up on me because she didn't want to deal with looking into the account."
2010-05-14 18:46:48,"New York, NY",Michelle,,"On 11/13/2008, I made an over payment on my Sallie Mae tuition account, in the amount of $229.89. Ironically, I did not know, and found a check for that amount, with no ""void after"" date printed on it at all. I deposited the check on 3/1/2010, and on 3/3/2010, Sallie Mae withdrew the funds back from my account, and I was also charged a $15 returned check fee by my bank. I called Sallie Mae, and spoke to a customer service representative, who indicated that the issue would be resolved. I had to call back in April, to inquire about when the reimbursement check would be mailed out, and they told me that needed a copy of the check I deposited.I asked them why they didn't tell me that, when I initially called, and they could not explain why not. So on 4/9/10, I faxed in the copy of the check, and they confirmed receipt of the fax from their Quality Assurance Department. On 4/15/10, I called again, and a customer representative said, a rush request would be put on this replacement check request. On 4/23/10 11:05AM, I called to follow up, and spoke to a rep named Anita, regarding an update on the replacement check. She said it was pending, and that she would put a rush on it. On 4/27/10, 10:30AM, I spoke to a rep named Valerie. She resubmitted as a rush for the 3rd time, and asked for me to call back on Friday.  On 4/30/10 02:38 PM, I spoke with an employee named Bill (who identified himself as a supervisor), and he said he doesn't know when this check will get cut, but told me to give it 14days. If no check, then call back and ask to speak to a supervisor on 5/14/2010.On 5/14/10, 06:16PM, I spoke with rep named Herb, who said he will need to put in a request for me to speak to a supervisor. It's been over 2 months, and I am getting the runaround about a check for funds, that are owed to me. Please give me any advice on what I could do."

Sallie Mae ""representatives"" have been calling my phone and my mother's phone multiple times a day attempting to collect delinquent payments. Because of my work as an RN locally and out of town, I am unable to call or always have my payments in on the exact day of payment. But they have always been paid within 20 days of due date. My mother who cosigned my student loan is battling cancer and has no need or concern related to this matter. She and my family have been constantly woken at 8:00 most mornings (whoever may be home) and called again within two hours, even after speaking with someone representing Sallie Mae. I have just again spoken with a Sallie Mae rep and she sees ""no problems with my payments"" and is sending it to ""research"". This has gone on for almost a year. Enough is enough. They say they ""will try to put a hold on the phone calls, but have no guarantee to do so."" I have been paying my student loans for over two years. All of them.

The customer service department is a joke and the supervisors are just as bad if not worse.

He added to return the completed document within 48 hours. I never received the form.I called Sallie Mae having to wait 10 minutes on hold and a customer service representative hung up when I asked for Dennis, collections manager. I called back and after holding again, a CSR M. was difficult to speak with. Most of the CSR's speaks very broken English and a communication barrier is so real as soon as they answer. M. would not connect me with Dennis; she would not answer any of my questions due to her script that she was running through. It was as though I was speaking to a machine. I was disconnected again while asking consistently to speak to the collections manager Dennis. While searching the web I found an Economic Hardship Deferment form for Sallie Mae, filled it out, attached my last paystub and fax it with a cover to ** and to the attention of Dennis collection manager. No response from anyone until I called Sallie Mae on 04/26/2010. I immediately asked for a supervisor and the male on the other end of the line refused to connect me with a supervisor until I told him why I wanted a supervisor. I told him I was contacting the federal government and exposing there tactic of business that Sallie Mae is permitting to happen. A supervisor come on the phone immediately and stated his name was supervisor Dennis. I reviewed the past several days with him and asked him why he never faxed me the deferment sheet. He stated he never spoke to me before and someone is using his name. I recognized his voice and told him that I spoke to him and what he directed me to do. He put me on hold and come back, saying he found my documents and would submit them to the Finance Department and I should call in 24 to 48 hours and ask for him so we can discuss my Economic Deferment.

They told me to wait 4-6 weeks for processing. I called, and now they are telling me 4-6 weeks, and they will refund me. I have called 2 to 3 times a week for 2 months.

Now, the son refuses to pay it. I paid over $800 on the loan, hoping his son would start paying something. Now, my husband has lost his job and they are calling us everyday, often more than once. Letters and threats come constantly. They threaten credit reporting but it is on my husband's report now. How long can they do this to us? We are 60 and 65 and have our own bills to survive. We had a FICO score of around 800 and this has ruined our credit. I am 65 and have retired but we are in danger of losing our home now. This is making me very sick and the stress over the last year or two is more than I can even deal with anymore. I have to go on meds just to deal with the harassment. I am so depressed!"
2010-04-23 04:00:00,"Chino, CA",Melinda,,"I took out a Sallie Mae loan for my son, back in 2006. I made the payments on it, until he graduated from college, of which he set up direct deposit to pay on the loan. By doing this, he received a 0.25% less on the loan (6.375 - 6.125). After 36 consecutive payments, a 1% discount is made off the loan, lowering the rate to 5.125%. My son was making the payments religiously. Last year, I went back to college to get my MBA, paying cash, and Sallie Mae gets a notice from my college (they have to do this by law), and puts this loan on deferment. My son was not aware, because he has everything set up on auto-pay.Once we realized this, we called Sallie Mae, and asked them to stop the deferment. In the meantime, Sallie Mae had accrued over $2,000 in capitalized interest. We were sick. Here, my son was paying on it, and they stopped taking the payments out of his account. In January, I called and told them to stop the deferment. They did with the 1st payment in February, and by March, they had put it into deferment again. When I called to tell them that I do not want this loan in deferment, and do not put it into deferment, unless I personally ask them, or put it in writing. I also stated that I wanted something from them in writing, to stop the deferment, and state that they would not put this loan into deferment again, unless I request it.I got a letter, and it stopped the deferment but in big caps the letter states, ""Sallie Mae reserves the right to modify or discontinue loan programs at any time, without notice"". I was furious. Back in Aug 2009, our outstanding balance was $38,371.43. Now it is $39,943.88, of which Sallie Mae has earned $2,584.18 of capitalized interest, by them deferring my loan, anytime they want. I am still in school, and my school has to inform them each quarter by law. Sallie Mae automatically puts it in deferment, and I can not say, write, or do anything to stop them, and Sallie Mae, instead of helping those to pay them back, are hurting us by charging more interest, without permission. This is not fair at all. It stopped our consecutive payments, so now there are 19 more payments to make to get the extra 1% off. Sallie Mae accrued $2,584.18 of capitalized interest. This is not fair at all. Please help."
2010-04-21 02:43:16,"Mystic, CT",Jacqueline,,"My student loan payments have been processed incorrectly on multiple occasions. I pay well over the minimum payment and always on time. I have nine loans altogether and specify the extra money (over the minimum payment) to be applied to the loan with the highest balance/interest accrual. Sallie Mae (against my clear request) has applied my payment to specific loans at their discretion, leaving other loans unpaid yielding a delinquent status. I have called multiple times and have been assured that the problem has been fixed. I have been making payments precisely the way that the Sallie Mae representative advised me to in order to pay down my higher interest loans in a shorter period of time. I was told to write in the memo of the check specifically how I would like the payment to be dispersed and to also include an index card/loose piece of paper with the disperse instructions written on it as well. As of yesterday, my account continues to be in delinquent status. I called again but have severe doubts that it is rectified or that it will not happen again in the future. They make the billing process virtually impossible to understand; even the requested ""itemized lists"" do not contain any specific comprehensible data. In addition to this, I was told that my ""minimum payment"" (clearly printed on the bill) is not enough to cover all my loans. So good thing I have been paying more than the minimum payment. I was also told that paying online may reduce some of these mistakes but I am not willing to give this company any of my banking information. Something does not smell right with the practices of this company. Please investigate!"
2010-04-21 00:45:52,"Charlotte, NC",Tracy,,"I have had this account with Sallie Mae for several years. I graduated in 2004. Since then, I have had numerous problems. I made payment on account over the phone, gave my bank account number. The rep read back the number, however, entered the number wrong and payment did not go through. I did not find out about this for 6 months and was made to pay penalty for their mistake. I have made payments and not had them posted or registered on time and got notified that we have ""missed"" payments. They have been harassing my father who is the co-signer on account. Calling 4-5 times a day! They have made false claims, i.e. told my father that account has been placed in collections but I am current. Also, they told my father that they had spoken to me and claiming that I had told them to contact him. In fact, I had told them to not contact him.One representative was insulting my brother when they were speaking to him. When you call to speak to a supervisor, one is never available. They call our house on near daily basis even though we are current on payments or have made arrangements for the month. We are told we are on automatic list to call and that they are not aware of reason for call until they look at file. When asked about paying off loan, we are told that if we pay off loan early, there is a penalty and it will be reported negatively to credit bureau. I have lost or misfiled confirmation numbers for payments."
2010-04-16 02:51:14,"Melbourne, FL",Victoria,,"I was attacked badly in 2001 (raped, set on fire, and beaten almost to death). This is cake walk to get over versus what Sallie Mae has done to me. I started to go to International Academy of Design and Technology in Orlando in 2003. I told them that I wanted to start over in a career that would be able to help me and others like me. I had been in the medical field for 4 years and made OK money. They said, I could make more. They encouraged me to try out the college and I did! Sallie Mae was the nightmare I woke up to.So now, I am going through two battles: the Guy who tried to murder me and the one of Sallie Mae. Guess which one is worse? I didn't get a job right away like the college promised (97% job placement assistance promised, that was a joke). I know what it is like now to beg for food just to feed myself. Though I know i had a roof over my head, no job. The calls started, they went to my parents, then to my old bosses, then to family and friends. They have ruined me exceptionally when I am facing the other fight. The degree was only suppose to be $30,000 and now it is $55,000. How? No, I can not borrow the money, no I can not move, no, I can not pay my debt, no, I can not just...Please understand, just like all of you, I wish for this money everyday to pay them. Instead, I get harassment, letters of default, calls to everyone, again like others mentioned, they have my number, address, and I try to make arrangements for payments I can afford. They are not willing to help. I told them that I will be laid off in June to October. I finally get a job and almost two years later, I face layoffs like a lot of you! By the way, did I mention when I did land this job they did not except my degree, so I don't get the money that the college said I would get. I make just enough to get by. I can't afford $500 plus, which is almost half of what I bring home.Now, the worst part off the story is... I lost my Uncle Garret 6 months ago to cancer at the age of 41. He left behind a beautiful family. Sallie Mae has been calling her 2x or 3x a day for about a month. She is left to raise 3 kids (youngest is 6, 12, oldest 14) and run a company and she is still in mourning. I received a letter from Sallie Mae's lawyers to settle for half the amount. I only had 5 days to respond and had to pay it in full. Who has that kind of money anymore. I just don't know what to any more. That is why I am writing this message. There is more to come as I still face these battles... my rapist is facing justice, why isn't Sallie Mae?"
2010-04-15 02:39:59,"Annandale, VA",Christa,,"I have co-signed a student loan for my son eight years ago.  My son has lost his job over a year ago and is unable to find work. My husband is 78 and in ill health.  I am 72 and on the brink of a nervous breakdown. We are living on a yearly income, which is considered poverty level. My husband has a small property to sell and wants to use that little money $ 40.-- to pay off the loan. The original loan was $ 42.000.  Now it has risen to over $ 51.000 due to late fees, interest, etc.Sallie Mae claims not to have a settlement department and my type of loan does not qualify for settlement. No further explanation given. It is like ramming your head against the wall, amounts to psychological warfare, and money extortion. We do not want to walk away, but are honorable people fallen on hard times. We want to settle but Sallie Mae will not hear of it. My husband wants to settle the loan."
2010-04-13 00:21:07,"Glenburn, ME",Linda,,"These people are impossible. Yes, my son did borrow money from them and yes, he does owe the money. His first payment was due, he has moved out of the country, which I made them fully aware of and just recently got a job, which I told them as well and I verified that they had the correct email address to contact him. I co-signed on 2 of the loans and made the first payment for my son, it wasn't even 30 days late when I made it. They call my house 5 and 6 times a day. I have told them all the above information 3 times, which they actually read back to me and say yes and they apologize for calling. Now they call incessantly, just a few minutes ago I told them again, the lady said I didn't call you it's done by computer, what a smart individual. I told them to stop calling me that they had all the information on my son and that I had made the payment for what I owed and if I owed anything else, to send me my bill, which as a cosigner I am entitled to before I make a payment. She told me the calls would continue, unfortunately, as the computer did it?! These people should be dragged through the court system and to congress for their crooked dealings. The interest rate on these loans is ludicrous, they give kids money and make it easy for them to do, which they do as they are desperate to go to school. Little do they know they are going to get screwed in the long run. How many people have committed suicide from this B.S. They are worse than the IRS is and this is only my son's first payment. They then stated that me and my ex husband co-signed, which we have been divorced for almost 8 years and my ex husband never paid a dime nor co-signed for anything for my son's education. They have contacted my sister to ask her if she knew where Linda C. was, which when I spoke to them, specifically told them I was married back in 2008 and my name was now A and to please change it. They are impossible, I have read so many nightmares about these people, it is ridiculous, why haven't they been investigated and stopped?"
2010-04-08 07:52:35,"Kansas City, MO",John,,"There was payment in the amount of $2,000 from the account of ** and ** written on our Capitol Federal Savings account that was sent via check in late October 2009, intended to be our payments for the entire year (until October 2010). On November 3, 2009, that check was presented for electronic payment from my account and was immediately transferred into a Sallie Mae bank account. To date, that $2,000 transfer has not been credited to my account with Sallie Mae. Although I have contacted Sallie Mae via 26 faxes and over 20 phone calls, Sallie Mae has not been successful in crediting my account with the missing $2,000 that was electronically taken from my account nearly five months ago. I am getting frustrated and tired. Now, Sallie Mae is calling my husband bi-weekly at work and at home demanding payment for our ""past due"" account and have marked our account in forbearance. There is no motivation on their part in find this missing $2,000 or they would have found it by now. I have provided a certified letter from my bank showing the date, amount and the electronic transfer information that should have been needed to trace down this money. What recourse do I have?"
2010-04-06 14:54:29,"Olean, NY",Susan,,"I took out student loans for all of my college and trade education. Payments started October 2001. In the past two years, I have fallen on some difficult times, divorce, unemployment and have been unable to make my payments and got forbearance or deferments. I recently got a new job and asked for an income-based payment plan, which allowed me to have lower payments until my income is such that I can afford the regular payments. From the beginning of the application process, this experience has been a mess from them losing my application to being given inaccurate information as to completing the application to being told the wrong start date of my payments. I recently signed up for payments to be take directly out of my checking account in the amount of $71.00 per month. I received a letter from Sallie Mae last week, 3/29-4/2/10, stating that the first payment would be taken from my account of April 1, 2010. I have been monitoring my checking account for the payment to be taken out and to date, it has not. So I went on the Sallie Mae Servicing website to check my account to find that they have not taken the payment out of my account and are charging me late fees ($53.00). I called customer service. Of course, I did not get a CS representative from the US, which wastes my time because I have to ask for them to repeat everything that they say because I can not understand them. I asked why the payment was not deducted from my account. I was told that they could not find my bank, then I was told that they did not have the correct bank information. I then asked to be transferred to a US representative because I don't have time to ask that each sentence or question be repeated because I can not understand or hear what is being said. Because I was at work, I was unable to wait for a US representative to come on the line (I waited over 20 minutes on hold). Because of all of the mistakes and delays in my ""paperwork"", I have accrued large amounts of late fees and interest, aside from the immense frustration that I have had to endure. So even though you receive paper confirmation of the arrangements, it still does not matter because ""they"" don't do their jobs and I pay for it."
2010-04-03 14:47:23,"Chicopee , MA",Stephanie,,"Never ever get a loan through these people! First of all they don't send me statements in the mail when they are due. They wait until the payments are late to send me a statement. Then when I request a statement, they send it to me after my due date so I end up late. I think they purposely make it difficult for you to make payments on time. Then when your payments are late they will harass you 3 to 4 times a day until they receive payments no matter how often you've told them you've sent out the payment.As for their website, that's a joke. They called me and told me my payment was three days late but the website was stating I was 33 days late. When I called to straighten that out, not only did I get hung up on three times, but I found out that my 33 day urgent delinquency was due to 2 pennies! Are you serious? You are gonna harass me over two ** pennies! These people make it impossible to pay them back. I can't make my payments and applying for deference or forbearance just makes the life of your loan longer. So I will make payments when I can make them. What are they gonna do? Sue me? I have nothing! I can't find a job and I don't own a damn thing.So never use Sallie Mae and if you already do and you are having trouble like me, good luck to you and I mean that sincerely."
2010-04-02 18:18:40,"East Lansing , MI",Lorely,,"I've been trying to lower my monthly payments with Sallie Mae based on my income. First, they sent me to the website where my account does not exist on their records neither does my SSN. Then I speak to an Indian lady who spent 30 minutes on the phone. The only action I needed was for her to send me the income-sensitive repayment forms (which are not on the website). I got the forms, filled them out and stated that I needed to pay about 5% of my gross monthly income. I got my booklet with the wrong payment amount. Called and spent 20 minutes with an Indian guy who I did not understand and could not help me. He transferred me to his ""supervisor"" which was an answering machine stating that they were closed. No opportunity to leave even a VM."
2010-04-01 16:55:53,"Calabasas, CA",Clinton,,"I applied for a career loan from Sallie Mae as they were the lenders on record for my school. I received the loan with a co-signer and the loan was dispersed to the school. The loan payments were to be $10.00 a month until I finished school. Without any warning, the $10 payments escalated to $300 while I was still in school and unemployed. By the time I found out about the escalation of payments, I was delinquent in payments and Sallie Mae collection department 765 area code called both me and my co-signer relentlessly... all day and night!I went online and applied for forbearance, they told me I did not qualify so I asked them what I qualified for, they said nothing which I later found out was a lie. This was in December.  In January they said we could qualify but they needed a letter from the school stating that I was a full-time employee, they received that in January. Again they never informed me they received the information they needed and the loan terms were to revert back to $10. Of course that did not happen. Finally in March I spoke with a woman by the name of Carlene at ext. 52041, she told me that I could only qualify for two types of reductions; a reduction in principal or the $10.As I am not working, I opted for the $10 payments for the next 11 months. I had this conversation the first of March at which time I was told in order to get this change in terms, I had to make a payment of $300, I did. I was told that I would receive a letter with the change of terms, to sign and return. I did. Although I requested this change of terms in January and was told that they were rolling back the other payments because my original request was from January, they did not! They breached their agreement and I spoke with 2 managers, even a manager in the department that processes the loan terms. Sallie Mae employs the rudest, ill-mannered, unprofessional and incompetent people they can find. Every dreg of society works here. I had someone tell me that I had no choice but to deal with him. I had another representative tell me that I should pay my bills and yet another told me that if I reduced my payments to $10, I would have to pay more later. Duh! Now they want to give me financial advice, please just get my account right and stop threatening my family and the co-signer with going to the credit bureau and making false reports."

Each time I send them the requested information, they then deny it for a different reason. I have now fax to them 5 times exactly what they need and they still have not process my request. My credit is in jeopardy and I feel that Sallie Mae is not assisting me . When I asked them to escalate to a manger, they said they cannot do this and hung up on me - this happened 3 times. I cannot stand dealing with them and need assistance. Please help if you can. The damage is my credit is in jeopardy due to their lack of working my request in a timely manner."
2010-03-29 22:03:23,"Charlotte, NC",DaVon,,"DaVon, son. Shavone, mom. I am authorized on this account. Sallie Mae is harassing my son about payment on a student loan, but on several ocassions, we have called and stated that we have not received any correspondence and ask that they send this information to the post office address not the home address. There is a reason for the post office box (not getting my mail or getting other peoples mail). The school has this address as well as the student loan service. DaVon wants to pay his bill. but Sallie Mae is not responding to our request to send correspondence. On 3/6, DaVon talk to someone, but did not get a name and related this issue, on 3/17, Shavone talk to Jennifer and related the same issue address, and on 3/25, I spoke with Everett and he stated he, I (Shavone) was not authorized, and then on that same day, DaVon talk to Cindy and told her to add Shavone to this account and also related the same issue; correspondence. We have not received anything after we were told they will send correspondence to the post office box. Today is 3/29 and we have received nothing. They are harassing DaVon on his cell phone number, but are not listening. I have not talk to a supervisor or manager; we did not request to talk to one. Can you help us get what we are asking for? Also we do not have an address for them, so therefore, they never sent anything to the home or post office box address.When they call with the harrassing, they stated your credit will be ruined and that is not fair for someone who is trying. DaVon will not make payments online, he does not trust the payment method. Please help and tell Sallie Mae to stop with the harrassing calls. Thank you and also send the correspondence."
2010-03-26 18:34:12,"El Cajon, CA",Mark,,"Our son used Sallie Mae to obtain several student loans. On two of the loans he had cosigners, one with his father and another with his mother (my wife). I recently tried to refinance my mortgage only to realize that my credit score is in the toilet because our son is 3 payments behind on our loan with him. In talking with our son's account manager at Sallie Mae I was told that he could only talk about our loan, not any of the others. He also said that our son had not sent him any money since he had been working with him on catching up his payments. In talking with our son, he said that he had sent money to this individual, and that he had instructed him to apply the moneys that he had sent to the two loans that had the cosigners. He did this because he could not pay on all of his loans, but was sensitive to the need for him to be first responsible to his parents so that our credit would not be negatively affected. It turns out that the Sallie Mae person has lied to me, and not only that, but he did not do as he was instructed by our son. Our son made it clear to the Sallie Mae account manager that he wanted the funds to go to these cosigned loans, but the Sallie Mae person applied the moneys (all of the moneys) to the accounts that did not have cosigners. Personally, I think what he did should be illegal. Note: I do have this person's contact information."
2010-03-24 16:23:31,"Copperas Cove , TX",Michael,,"I got a Sallie Mae loan in 2005. At the time of the loan, I thought I was just getting a loan to go to college. Well, Sallie Mae informed me that I was getting a Tuition Answer Loan and that I needed a co-signer. I had my mother co-sign for the loan. At the time of getting the loan, we were never told or given a promissory note or a disclosure not. So we had no idea that this was a private student loan that is compounding daily interest according to Wall Street. When the economy hit rock bottom a couple of years ago and insurance premiums hit record highs, I was not able to pay for my student loan. So my wife called Sallie Mae and tried to apply for a police officer forgiveness loan since I am a police officer. She was told that we could not do that because it is a private loan. While she called the Congressman's office and the Department of Education to see what our options were to find out there was nothing that we can do because it's a private student loan. Well then I went to an attorney and tried to file bankruptcy on this loan and I am told that I cannot do this because it is a student loan. Keep in mind that I have been told it is a private loan!So I have been talking with Karyn O with the customer advocacy department at Sallie Mae and try to get questions answered. To find out my wife was correct when she said that this loan was given under deceit and deception and that we were never given or signed a promissory note or a disclosure statement saying that we would this loan compounds daily interest according to Wall street. This is fraud! Also, for the last four years, Sallie Mae has never sent us a 1098 so that we can claim the interest that we have paid on our taxes. When I asked Karyn with Sallie Mae customer service advocacy department, she told me because Sallie Mae did not know what we were using the money for that they did not send us our 1098 to claim the interest on our taxes. Wrong answer. The check was made out to me and the school so how can they even say they did not know what the money was used for. Correct me if I'm wrong, that's why it's called a Tuition Answer Loan. Just another way to scam consumers! I have called my Congressman, Congressman Carter, and have demanded that this kind of deception stop! Sallie Mae is taking advantage of many Americans that are just trying to get an education. Then the big kicker is that Sallie Mae was talking to my wife instead of me without giving my written or verbal consent. That is against the privacy act. So how many other Americans has Sallie Mae given student Answer Loan too without a promissory note or a disclosure note and now you owe double from what you borrowed? We need help and stop Sallie Mae from defrauding consumers and Americans that are just trying to get and education. Sallie Mae customers receiving Tuition Answer Loans need help and stop them defrauding Americans trying to get an education!"
2010-03-22 14:24:05,"Big Pine Key , FL",Colleen,,They are constantly calling me at work several times a day. I have asked them to stop. I am overwhelmed with medical bills and other issues right now. They refuse to talk to me or work me on any kind of payment plan. The people that call are very rude and demanding. My supervisor heard me talking to them this morning and wanted to know what was going on. Very embarrassing. They refuse to send anything in the mail. It is all phone calls to my work. They also call at all hours of the night. Please help. I have had to move because I could not afford to live where I was staying. I want to make payments but I want the phone calls to stop. I am just a records clerk. I do no make a lot of money. I am becoming ill from the stress. My boss is becoming suspicious. I am afraid I will lose my job if this continues.
2010-03-20 15:12:24,"Ofallon, MO",Melissa,,"Upon graduating from school, I owed approximately $28,000. Two years later, I still owe $28,000. I have had my loans in forbearance for about six months, because I am unemployed, but after paying for a year and a half, and still paying interest, my loans have not gone down. Where is the money going? I get statements, sometimes, that tell me I only paid $5.87 that month. I call and get someone who barely speaks English. When I try to explain, they tell me they are transferring me to a different department, and hang up on me. Every time I try to get online, it tells me my password is incorrect, or I need to contact them. I contact them, and I get transferred, and hung up on again. I have emailed them, and asked to have someone call me, who speaks English, and can actually help me.A foreign person calls at the most inconvenient times, and tells me to call if I'm having problems. I don't know what to do. I have no idea what I owe, or where my payments are actually going. Is there someone I can talk to? I can't get straight answers, and I can't log onto my account. Can someone please help? I am currently part of a class action lawsuit against the school I attended, that Sallie Mae is the leading loan company. I was encouraged to borrow as much as I could from them, and told not to consolidate my loans. If I don't get this straightened out soon, I'm going to be paying until I'm dead."
2010-03-12 17:13:17,"Oakland, CA",Janet,,"I was reviewing my entire loan transaction history with SallieMae online. I took out a $12,000 loan in 1993 at 5.5% interest with a 1% origination fee. It's been so long I can't even remember who the original lender was. SallieMae took over the loan a few years later, when the outstanding principal was about $8,000, with interest remaining at about 5%. When I add the total repayments made to SallieMae to date, they are nearly $28,000. $20,000 of which was applied to principal and $8,000 to interest.I will admit that I do not clearly understand these repayment terms; but they seem egregious to me, to put it mildly. I called SallieMae and requested a fluent English-speaking representative. I spoke with this American citizen and she could not explain the terms to me either. Can someone please explain to me how SallieMae can apply $20,000 principal and $8,000 interest on an $8,000 loan at 5.5% and yet leave me with over $5,000 left to repay?There has got to be an illegal component to this scenario but I do not have the information to combat SallieMae. It sickens my stomach to think how a company could make billions with this kind of blood-money, and still report financial losses and demand Federal (i.e. taxpayer) bailouts. Someone help. Please. On a larger scale, lenders like this are what contributed to our current economic crisis. Admittedly, some people who took out loans were ignorant and/or greedy. However the predatory lending practices of these financial institutions cannot be excused."
2010-03-05 19:54:14,"Cambridge, MD",Paul,,"In October 2009, due to personal financial constraints, I phoned my student loan service provider, Sallie Mae, and officially renegotiated student loan repayment terms enabling me to remain in good standing about this financial obligation. A 2-page document I received from Sallie Mae dated 10/7/09 clearly defines the new payment schedule agreed on by both parties, including a lower monthly payment for eight consecutive months, beginning on 1/15/10. Hard copy and/or faxed/scanned copy of revised loan repayment schedule is available upon request. This document states ""this schedule replaces all previous schedules for these loan(s), and does not include any past due amounts. All of the terms of your original promissory note(s) still apply"".To be certain, I phoned Sallie Mae on 10/21/09, and again on 1/12/10, to confirm the reduced payment amount due on 1/15/10. Both Sallie Mae customer service representatives, with whom I spoke assured me of the accuracy of the revised loan re-payment schedule, and assured me that the new, lower payment amount would be automatically debited from my personal checking account, as were my previous payments under the previous/original repayments schedule.  With this data from Sallie Mae, I planned and implemented various bill payments in January 2010 from my personal checking account.  On 1/22/2010, I received a notice from my bank dated 1/19/2010, that my personal checking account had been overdrawn, and that the line-of-credit feature with my account, including a $10 service fee, had been activated to cover debts claimed on my account.  Quick research revealed that the Sallie Mae Student Loan payment amount had been charged to my account in the higher, previous (now defunct) scheduled payment amount.I immediately phoned Sallie Mae, spoke with customer service manager, Ansley, and absolutely insisted that Sallie Mae correct the error they made in billing for my January 2010 loan payment regarding the newly negotiated repayment schedule on my loan. My claim includes a $10 compensation from Sallie Mae for the line-of-credit service fee my bank charged to me, because of Sallie Mae's billing error. Upon my repeated insistence, Sallie Mae reversed the appropriate portion of overpayment on my loan in January 2010, but is now refusing to compensate me for the $10 bank fee charged to me because of their error.  My formal request for the $10 compensation was made in writing to Sallie Mae on 1/22/2010 as per their customer service manager's instructions.  Sallie Mae's written refusal to compensate me for the $10 fee, is stated in hard-copy letter to me dated 2/22/10. ""We cannot refund your bank fee of $10.00, because we did not make a servicing error on your account"".  The 10/7/09 hard-copy document I have from Sallie Mae defining revised payment schedule is undeniable proof that Sallie Mae did, in fact, make a servicing error on my account in January 2010.My current request for simple, direct, dollar-for-dollar compensation from Sallie Mae for the $10.00 cost, I incurred because of Sallie Mae's loan servicing error is truly a reasonable customer requirement, given these circumstances. I respectfully request assistance in obtaining the indicated $10 compensation for costs I incurred because of Sallie Mae's error.  Thank you in advance for your anticipated help. Feel free to contact me should you require further details.  If you are unable to assist me directly with this problem, please direct me to whatever agency oversees, and regulates student loan service providers, such as Sallie Mae. Given my experience, I feel an obligation to follow-through to a satisfactory resolution, so that other student loan customers are not subjected to similar circumstances."
2010-03-05 00:02:27,"Gunnison, CO",Rachel,,"They will not process my in-school deferment, even though I and my school have given them the information that they need to do so. Now they're calling me and my mom constantly about me being past due when I really should not be. They have told me before that they had the information that they need, but today they tell me that my school needs to fax yet another enrollment verification. This is frustrating because I've done everything they've asked and they are harassing me when I'm trying to do my school work next to my preemie daughter's isolet in the hospital's NICU. I'm extremely stressed by them and cry constantly because I can't get them to leave me alone. Why can't they be competent and process my deferment?"
2010-03-02 22:14:25,"Lincoln, IL",Mary,,"In 2004, I took out a school loan with Sallie Mae. I was not able to come to an agreement on payment amounts. My income of social sec. had dropped due to the death of my husband. My daughter was making limited income. Sallie Mae turned the account over to a collection agency, in fact, there have been many collection agencies calling us. At present time, I believe it is with this company FMS services. My daughter has since lost her job due to downsizing and I have been in and out of the hospital many times over the years. My hospital and doctor bills are overwhelming me. The last snow and ice storm we had has caused leaking in my garage fastened to my house, and a storage shed in the back. I do not have the money to repair them. My question to you is, is Sallie Mae still considered the primary lender or can we take bankruptcy on this loan? On my credit report I last received in May 2008 and I thought they had written it was a bad loan and had written it off. I cannot find the report but will keep on looking."
2010-03-01 22:34:13,"Astoria, NY",Amanda,,"I submitted my payment two days before the due date. I received an email receipt validating and thanking me for my payment immediately thereafter. The next time I logged into my account, it said I am a day late on payment and have a delinquency status as a result, and that the negative ramifications this will have on my credit are imminent.I'm waiting on the phone for 35 minutes now, hoping someone behind the smoke and mirrors will pick up the phone and remedy this mistake! Throughout my dealings with Sallie Mae, I have contacted them via their email form numerous times, and never once received a reply back! Why then, would they have an email contact option at all, if they don't intend to check and respond to customers they claim to care about, but are truly out to rob and cause stress to? The customer service is terrible, flat out terrible. I wouldn't recommend Sallie Mae as a lender/guarantor to any financially needy student hoping to procure a decent education. Find anyone else!"

I try so hard to explain my situation to Sallie Mae and see if they would work with me on an affordable payment plan but they want me to pay about $300 a month on top of my bills.  Other people I know only pay $50 a month.  I talked to so many people at Sallie Mae and nobody has the right information about anything.  Nobody that works there knows what's going on with anything.I had to move out-of-state and away from my family and friends to try and go back to school because I can't take out anymore student loans because of Sallie Mae and I still can't find a job and all they do is harass me and my grandfather, who co-signed for me and no matter how many times I try to work with them, they say that they can't lower the payment.  So I can't pay them at all and my credit is so bad."

Then the rest of your life is ruined with fees and interest. They absolutely have no care or heart, but just greed. They do not work with you, they only work to suck the life out of you before you even get a chance to find a career. I'm dying to consolidate my loans and they are just uninterested because if I can't afford their massive interest amounts, they get to charge me more fees!I so wish someone would have explained this better or at least notified me that Sallie Mae is such a terrible company. If anyone finds a way out, please, please let me know. Thank you."

I haven't received my new checks yet. I have explained this daily to a Sallie Mae rep for the past 2 weeks.  All I am ever told is that I will keep getting the phone calls until I can give them my account information and take care of the matter (I am only 36 days overdue).  Trust me, if I had the info, I would give it to them just to make them stop calling me.So, today at 8:11 am, I got a call on my cell phone.  I kindly explained to the girl that I am waiting for the bank to open at 10 and I will try to get resolution today.  She reminded me I can go online and make the payment and even postdate a payment, but she will document the call.  I also removed about 4 phone numbers that were over 4 years old, which I have done monthly with Sally Mae.At 8:45 this a.m., I got a call from Sallie Mae on my home phone.  I was probably a little more short-tempered because they have to ask all the questions and verify that they are only speaking to the account holder.  I told the girl that I had already talked to someone today and I would appreciate them only calling me daily.  She apologized and said that there must have been an error in their system and that I should receive no more calls.At 9:15 am, they called me on my cell again.  I kept asking to speak to an account supervisor and the girl wouldn't connect me to one until I went over everything with her first.  She was so rude and didn't even apologize for the disruption of my day.  I only wanted an apology because what they are doing is harassment.  She kept calling me ""maam"", which is so condescending and rude when I asked her not to do that.  I finally just said, I don't want to talk to another inept agent. Please connect me to your supervisor.  She put me on hold for 9 minutes, got back on the phone, and said I would have to speak with her only.  And when I started to speak, she hung up on me.After that, I was ticked off.  In 1 hour, I received 3 calls and they admitted that I shouldn't have received the calls because of problems in their system.  My mom calls me because they called her to say that I was unreachable and possibly avoiding speaking with them and she is freaking out.  That was done out of retaliation!  I only owe them $156 and they are calling my family members?So, I called the customer service number.  I went through the verification questions and asked to speak to a supervisor.  I got Cory on the phone, who is a senior collection agent.  His supervisor is Chad.  Guess what, they don't have to give out their last names!  I wish I had a job where I could be rude and obnoxious all day and never be accountable for that!  The first thing out of his mouth was that if I paid my bill on time, I wouldn't have to speak to them.  Thank you moron for stating the obvious!  Then, he told me that they can call me constantly during the day to do their ""due diligence"" until the bill is paid.  It is harassment!  He refused to even acknowledge or apologize that there was a problem because ""I am the cause of all my own problems"".  That was his brilliant customer service!  Well Cory, I hope you love your job because you do it well.  You are rude and misrepresent everything what customer service is meant to be. I don't know what my rights are as a citizen, but I know that they violated some of my rights today.  It is hard enough when you are unemployed to not be able to meet your debts on a quarter of your income.  I have spoken to all my creditors who have been pretty amicable towards me, but SM is being ridiculous.  I can and want to pay the bill - I just don't have an account that I can access the monies out of right now.  I don't deny or argue that the bill is 6 days over the 30 past due.  But you have to give me a chance to fix it before you get that rude and retaliatory.  I just feel that it is ridiculous what they are doing and something needs to change."
2010-02-24 20:22:57,"Santa Fe, NM",Pia,,"I am writing today because I am a student, unemployed and a disabled person with student loans taken out to pay my living expenses. After paying my bills for two months, I have just under $300 to myself for other living expenses for several months.My concern is specific to a conversation I have had with my financial aid representative at Argosy University in Chicago, IL. As an older student, I entered an MA program knowing I would have to get loans to pay bills and I have encumbered myself with future debt in order to achieve employability status. The problem that I have run into is that there are several procedures involved in disbursing student loan money which creates undue hardship for loan applicants, I in particular.What I learned in the conversation with my fin. aid rep recently was that when I apply for a loan from Sallie Mae (smart Option), Sallie Mae approves it, sends notice to the university, the university processes paperwork (certification+) and notifies Sallie Mae that my file is good to go, and Sallie Mae sends money to the university which has the option to pay out the money over the period of enrollment for that semester. The university ""disburses"" the money, but the Bank of Sallie Mae sends the check to the loan recipient.Because of this convoluted and drawn out process of disbursing loans, I personally experienced the most aggravating and destitute time of my life this January. I applied for my loan early Dec. and was approved Dec 4, 2009. After several conversations with my fin aid rep at that time, I realized that he was dragging his feet and making mistakes in handling my loan papers. I had to go over his head to discuss the handling of my loan because I had budgeted with the expectation that my loan would arrive the first week of classes, as stated by the university. I did not receive my loan disbursement (1/2 of the approved loan) until the last Friday of January. Then I had to wait for my bank to clear the check.The outcome of this experience is that I need you to know that as a disabled American with the usual bills (rent, car loan, auto insurance, phone, and food with no health insurance); I am very concerned that students are subjected to incredibly inefficient management of loans.My question to you is can this process be streamlined? Why can't I apply for a loan (over and above my tuition costs), have the school certify my enrollment and then have the bank send my money directly to me. Why do I have to live with incredible uncertainty and hardship?The request I would like to make is that considering the high numbers of newly enrolled students across the country this past year, the inability of university financial aid staff to efficiently handle increased volumes of applicants and our need as a country to help stimulate the economy that rules for handling student loan disbursement be revamped to address this complicated paradigm. There is no good reason that I should have to wait for several companies to handle my loan as I wonder if I'll have enough food before my next check arrives, or if I can pay for the gas to get me to my volunteer job.The current system of disbursement has too many negative impacts on students. Please consider my request in earnest."
2010-02-23 21:15:01,"Pearland, TX",Jennifer,,"Monday, February 08, 2010, my employer's payroll coordinator entered my office to inform me that she received an order of withholding from earnings form for me from TG Collections. I immediately called them, thinking it must be a mistake. I was told the garnishment is for two defaulted student loans (from 2006) with Sallie Mae. I believed there has to be a mistake because I was under the impression that all of my loans were through ACS and Wachovia (formerly Educaid) and I had been making regular payments to them upon receiving my first invoices.I also questioned why I had never received any invoices for the Sallie Mae loans. They asked me to verify my contact information and I discovered they had a mailing address that I had not used since early 2001, which made no sense at all, since I had lived at my current address since early 2003 and had not even begun school until the summer of 2003. Further, I had lived at another address from early 2001 to early 2003. The TG representative instructed me to contact Sallie Mae directly. I called Sallie Mae and was told that they did not see any loans for me in default and that they had been paid in full, so I called TG again. This time I was told that the account (with Sallie Mae) shows paid in full because TG already compensated Sallie Mae for the defaulted loans. The TG representative suggested I visit the National Student Loan Data System to be certain the loans in question are mine. I logged onto the website that evening and deduced that, yes, the loans must be mine. I then realized there must be some impact on my credit report so I signed up with freecreditreport.com and discovered that my credit was wrecked because of the defaulted loans. Devastated, I decided it would be in my best interest to begin paying the debt immediately and then focus on clearing up my credit report with Sallie Mae. I followed up with TG the following day telling them that I am not contesting the debt and I would like to arrange a payment schedule. They told me that since the account was in garnishment, arranging repayment was no longer an option for me. I began to question them as to why they had not contacted me at my current residence before placing my account in garnishment but they claim the only contact information they had for me was the address and phone number received from Sallie Mae. I asked them that if they could contact my employer for garnishment, why then had they not contacted me prior to placing my account in garnishment, when repayment would have been an option? I was told they did everything required under the law and that it was my problem not theirs if they received incorrect contact information. The representative suggested I fill out a ""hardship"" form if I did not desire to have my wages garnished and mailed on to me, which I received a week later. The form, however, clearly states that, ""If you wish to enter into a repayment agreement in order to prevent wage withholding, do not use this form. Instead, contact the TG Collections Department at...."" So, I called TG yet again, to tell them that, yes, I wish to enter into a repayment agreement. I was told that this is a standardized form and, again, repayment is not an option. All of this is very strange to me. Sallie Mae never sending an invoice for the loans. Sallie Mae giving old contact information to TG. TG successfully tracking down my place of employment, but not being able to contact me at my current residence, which I have lived at since before starting school or receiving the loans. TG refusing to allow me to enter into a repayment agreement even though I have attempted to cooperate.I feel somehow that I have been railroaded. I shared as much with the last TG representative with whom I spoke. I told them I would be writing to Consumer Affairs and contacting an attorney. The TG representative tried very hard to talk me out of contacting an attorney, suggesting that I have no alternative other than having my wages garnished or (possibly) working something out if the hearing finds in my favor. The garnishment will begin this Friday, February 26, 2010. I wish I knew if there was some sort of injunction I could file to stay the garnishment until after the hearing (in the hope that they do find in my favor). Further, I sincerely hope that some sort of class action suit is filed against Sallie Mae because I would like to have my credit restored."
2010-02-20 22:16:05,"Va, VA",Kathleen,,"Like anyone, I had to get a student loan to go to school. I signed up with Sallie Mae for the whole tuition loan by myself. After I graduated, I found out I was signed up for 8 loans in my name. Never once getting a notice or phone call or email about this process happening. When I called, they said I owed 63,000 for a school that cost 35,000 and that I signed a piece of paper saying Sallie Mae could take money out in my name when needed! Never have I seen this paper or remember signing it and no one at Sallie Mae seems to be able to track this paper down.They have honestly ruined my life. I have had to seek medical help because of the endless phone calls, papers and people threatening me about my loans. I was put on medication because of all of this. Now they said, I didn't pay my loan for November and December, however, I got a call from a man named Dwight about being put into a program that would help lower my loans. However that never happened so I got a call from collections wanting me to pay a good faith payment of $20,000 or they would take me to court. I kept telling the man that I don't have that kind of money. He asked me to ask someone if I could borrow that amount, yeah right! So after that threat happened we settled on paying 381.30 a month to be taken out electronically on the 19th of February, however that didn't happen either.I'm starting to think that this will never end and that Sallie Mae just wants to string the students who loaned money from them along till the students are dead and their loved ones have to start getting harassed. I'm tired of threats and harassment. I thought there were laws to prevent this. For people like me who can't find a way out without thinking of horrible ways to end things. I want to know what is going to be done to prevent this kind of treatment of people in the future. This is starting to get ridiculous. My mental health has been hit so hard I had to be treated and medicated. I live paycheck to paycheck and after my payments I have $90 to live on for two weeks which is not enough left to pay bills to everyone else like doctors and phone bills."
2010-02-20 16:45:13,"Springfield Gardens, NY",Natalia,,"I graduated from law school in 2007 but was unable to find work. I subsequently took several deferments and informed that deferments were no longer available forcing me to pay for forbearance payments, which cost a total of $150 every three months for a year. As a result of their harassing behavior, they have inflicted severe stress and trauma on my family and me because they have failed to desist from harassing individuals who are attempting to comply with their demands. I subsequently went back to finish my final degree and while there, Sallie Mae continued to call me even after filing in-school deferments. After the completion of my classes, Sallie Mae sent me a bill that my bill was due on January 18, 2010, a national holiday. I called them the following day and processed an over-the-phone deferment of which they gave me a confirmation as proof that the transaction had been approved. Further, my credit card company processed the forbearance payment same day for $150 as shown on my credit card statement.I asked that they send me a copy of the forms and I was informed that it would take 30 days to send forbearance forms because I did not provide them an email address, which I thought was ludicrous. Shortly after receiving the forms, I was contacted by Sallie Mae stating that they did not receive the forms. After that conversation ended, I faxed the forms twice to the (570) number provided by the sales associate, with minor modifications: the forbearance forms sent by Sallie Mae requested an additional $97.49 payment, which I modified to $0.00. Yet, that did not stop them from contacting me at various hours during the day. Again, I contacted a Sallie Mae sales associate and she informed me that it would take 5-10 business days before the transaction would be processed and she informed me that I should ignore the letters and calls until the completion of this period. This time period is almost over, yet Sallie Mae continues to contact me. I sent them a cease letter informing them of the harassing behavior, as well as, proof of the processing of the payment by credit card company, yet they have continued to contact me. However, I believe they will continue their harassing behavior including continuing to mail demand letters to my mother as a co-signor on one of my loans, although I have complied with all of their requests except one, they are continuing to demand that I send the very forms faxed to them twice to a different number instead of the number that I have always faxed documents to. I find their behavior reprehensible because they continue to harass me and my family, although I have been the initiator of most of the contact and have complied with mostly all of their requests."
2010-02-20 15:23:21,"LaGrange, GA",Marsha,,"Avoid at all costs--thieves, dishonest, disreputable, less than truthful--are the best things I can say about them. Sallie Mae is worse than a loan shark. They are predators that prey on innocent students and the students desire to get a college education.Problems we have had are too numerous to expand on. One of the hidden charges is a $ 225.00 fee for disbursements of funds. In other words for mailing a check to your school, they are charging you not only the interest on the money, and also $225.00 for the envelope and the stamp. Stop before you sign on the dotted line. Go to your local bank or check out other options but stay far, far, far away from Sallie Mae."
2010-02-18 18:17:03,"Manchester, MO",Anthony,,"Sallie Mae is sitting on my tax refund! On December 13th, I have been told by Sallie Mae, a batch of previous borrowers were incorrectly added to the treasury off-set program, resulting in God knows how many peoples' refunds being taken away from them mistakenly. Since the amount is used for security questions and such, I can only say it was well over $2000. I have been calling everyday since January 29th for my expected refund deposit date, and everyday someone tells me another day that the check will be in the mail. They refuse to refund my money and I am losing my car, my transportation to school and to work.I am a landscaper and I depend on my tax refund as income during the slow winter months. When I am called back to work in a couple of weeks, I will have to decline as I will not have transportation. As of 2/18/2010, they are telling me that they will mail me my money next Wednesday. That is too late to receive funds to make my last car payment, and I will lose my car as a result. I've had it up to here with this non-sense and I hope my comment reaches someone. I hope someone has had the same experience, and I hoe to God if there is some sort of legal action I can take for their 'computer error'. I suspect the broke Sallie Mae is earning interest and investing our cash in short-selling stocks in order to make a quick buck, but who knows? Who cares? I want my money yesterday!"
2010-02-18 02:09:16,"West Seneca, NY",Brian,,"I had a payment due on 2/12/10, which I paid on 2/12/10 in the amount of $134.91. On Monday, February 15, 2010 I was contacted by a Sallie Mae representative notifying me that I was delinquent by 34 days. When I asked the representative if my payment had posted, she indicated it wasn't posted to the account; rather it was pending. The representative then indicated that my payment was one cent short and was placed on the automatic dialer due to this one cent delinquency. I said ""you're calling me a delinquent over one cent? The payment amounts are given to you via a checkbox. You indicate the loan you wish to pay then type in the amount and submit for conformation.It's been three days and I'm still receiving harassing phone calls from Sallie Mae. The first few calls I handled with care, clearly explaining their mistake. By the 5th call I'd had enough and asked to speak with a manager. I was told I could not speak with a manager until I paid my delinquent bill. I said, ""You want me to pay you a penny? It'll cost you more just to process the transaction than for me to pay a penny in which I do not owe."" The representative would not accept my answer even though I had talked to two other people the day before, and unless I paid the penny I would continue receiving phone calls. I paid the amount posted, not a penny more and not a penny less and have the documentation to prove it. Can they legally continue harassing me over a penny?"
2010-02-16 23:39:33,"Clarksville, TN",Wanda,,"I have been trying to make payment arrangements and to get them to stop calling my work cell phone 7 to 12 per day every day before I lose my job and all I get is rudeness, lies, and threats from them if I do not pay. No two representatives tell me the same thing. When I pay the amount one tells me then another calls the very day they cash my check and tells me I owe them a different amount. I only make between $11,000 to $15,000 gross per year yet my payments are around $350 per month and climbing. I have been trying to get them to lower them to a more affordable amount by sending in letters as instructed, paying amounts as instructed, resorting to begging and pleading telling them they are putting my job at risk. All I get in return is lies and threats.One agent told me that they would call my work cell as much as they like and didn't care if it cost me my job. He said if I wanted to keep my job, then I better pay my loans. I have remained current on my loans all this time until recently. I was losing my home because my loan payments are too high and I explained this to them and asked about lowering the payments. I have done everything they have told me to do and still they call every day demanding more. Now I have even split my loans up so that when I paid them the last $350 as instructed to bring me current. They continue with the harassing calls because they now say I have not paid on the private loans.I have made a single payment on my loans every month and this has never been the case until now when I am trying to work out some kind of lower payment plan. I finally did lose my home because I could not continue to pay these high payments on the loans and my rent. I have lived in my vehicle and with family and friends just trying to come up with the money to get these people off my back. I am now homeless and they do not care. Now they are threatening me with continued harassment using my work cell phone that can cost me my job.I can't use my cell while I am driving for work. Worse yet the cell phone records every call coming in. I've asked them repeatedly to stop calling that number but they refuse. They tell me to just pay my loans and then they will stop. I was never able to find work in the field I got my degree in. My income never went up because of that.I am still earning at poverty level, only now I am dealing with the nightmare of Sallie Mae harassing me several times on a daily basis. When I ask to talk to a supervisor I am told it will take at least 20 minutes or more to get one on the line. The agents also call my cell number and then when voice mail picks up just lets music play until the message gets timed out. They are harassing me not trying to work with me. I have not and am not trying to get out of paying my loans. I am only asking for some help in arranging affordable payments.If I lose my job, I will not only not be able to get a new home to live in but I will not be able to pay my student loans back or any other obligations I have to anyone else. What kind of sense does this make? I'm tired of it all. I'm frustrated by it all. I just want some straight answers and I want the harassment to stop. Please someone help me with this. I am drowning in this debt and harassment with no way out and Sallie Mae sure isn't willing to work with me. I don't know what else to do, please help. I can no longer afford to pay rent or get a home. The stress of dealing with all this is making me ill. My income is too low to handle the demands they are putting on me. I can't afford to live on my own or pay my bills because they will not work out an affordable payment plan and if the harassment keeps up, not only is the cell phone bill going thru the roof because of all the minutes they keep using but it can and will cost me my job if they do not stop calling my work cell phone."
2010-02-16 16:30:39,"Sandwich, MA",Kerri,,"Unfortunately, most of my student loans were serviced through Sallie Mae. As a student I was directed to use them by the college I attended. It was not until later that I discovered colleges are not to limit potential borrowers to specific lenders. Sallie Mae uses very abusive tactics: they call at almost anytime, numerous times, even on Sundays. In addition the Sallie Mae staff is verbally abusive. They attack borrowers, demean them and make allegations.I personally was told to get a third job, try harder getting a job, go back to school, should've picked a better major, I still live at home and should be able to pay, my parents should help me pay (I grew up with a single Mom who is unemployed and unable to help). This is only a small sampling of the verbal attacks on me. They withhold information and give false information. Twice I was told I did not qualify for forbearance when in fact I did. The longer they postpone any type of payment the more interest that builds up, so this in the end makes Sallie Mae more money.The information online differs from what they send in the mail. They claim they don't receive faxes (I have kept all fax information saying it was received). Constantly I have been lied to about payment options, interest and borrower options. Graduating into one of the worst economic situations that our nation has ever faced has been extremely difficult. Dealing with Sallie Mae has made things even worse. I now am anxious and will be examined to be put on anxiety meds. Sallie Mae has made me anxious worrying about payments, their constant calls, and my credit. In addition I have spent hours with them on the phone causing my cell phone bill to be high (I do not have the money for a land line and a cell phone is cheaper). My credit is now going to be damaged, when I could be on forbearance and have avoided this entire situation, but they withheld information from me."
2010-02-11 22:00:37,"Jensen Beach, FL",Cindy,,"My son went to Keiser University, we thought he took 2 loans, one for $5,600.00 and one for $2,900.00. The $5,600.00 is a private loan from Sallie Mae, which my father-in law co-signed and agreed to help Nick pay the monthly payments with. He has been paying for 3 years and the payoff is $5,300.00. When I looked at his loan summary the total of loans was $13.000.00. He only went to school one year, and we just got a bill from Keiser for $6,939.00 which is in collections. We were told the total cost of school was approximately $7,000.00. With all this confusion we have requested a forbearance, and when I call they hang up on me. They tell me they cannot do this until we pay this month's payment and we requested this last month. They call every hour for 8 hours every day, and they told us they can legally do that. They sent letters to relatives saying they can't locate Nick, but they spoke to him on the phone. Nick has moved home to help out with the bills. We are doing the best we can, I have asked for an audit of the account, they keep telling me they will mail it. I am beyond trying to talk to these people, is this something that needs an attorney who can help us? They told us the loan was for 10 years, how can that be. Nick has moved and I cannot find his paperwork from the school."
2010-02-11 21:10:02,"Stockton, CA",Rebecca,,"I was 17 years old when I enrolled at ITT Tech. My mother was Spanish speaking and both she and I did not understand the whole contract. Regardless, I was not able to pay anything to Sallie Mae because I had not started working and I was paying my cost of just renting and surviving after I turned 18. I am 23 years old and have been working part time for the last five years and cannot seem to gain full time employment. When I did my taxes 2009 for 2008, I received a large amount and paid Sallie Mae in full. My interest at that time was about 2,000. In the last year since its been paid off, I received another letter stating my interest was over $7,000.At this point, bad credit is not an issue. What is an issue is these crooks are still raising my interest and all money have been paid. I am still struggling behind economy and frustrated that the government allows these people to set up someone as myself. I want 0 balance on this account. I will make sure this email goes to other students or future students to not be set up."
2010-02-11 17:25:29,"Hillsborough, NC",Lois,,"I applied for 90 day forbearance in November 2009. Sallie Mae sent the form to me; I filled it out, faxed it back, and called to verify if Sallie Mae had received it. Sallie Mae verified they received the forbearance request and I would hear something soon. I did not.Sallie Mae collection calls began in December of 2009. The automated number would call my cell phone at least 15 times a day, sometimes more. I contacted Sallie Mae again and asked why I was receiving collection calls when I had applied for forbearance. They verified the forbearance form was in my loan folder but a decision had not been made yet then asked if I would make a payment. I responded that I could not, that's why I had applied for forbearance. I asked if my number could be taken off the automated collection system until Sallie Mae had reviewed my forbearance request and Sallie Mae said they could not do that until a payment was made.For the next 60 days, I received calls from Sallie Mae's automated collection number. I spoke with dozens of representatives who told me the forbearance request form was in the folder and promised someone would call me back. Then they would tell me I was delinquent and ask for immediate payment. At 75 days, I spoke with another Sallie Mae representative calling to collect.She informed me that I was 75 days delinquent and had been reported to the credit bureau. She stated that I needed to bring my account up to date immediately. I asked again about the forbearance request and received four different responses from her: 1. It had been denied. 2. It was not in my file. 3. The wrong person filled out the form. 4. Sallie Mae had no record of receiving a forbearance form for my account.After hearing this, I responded that she was absolutely lying. She placed me on hold and a manager picked up asking what he could do for me. After 50 minutes on the phone with Sallie Mae, I was told they could not find my forbearance request and at this point, they could open an investigation or I could make payments and they would waive the late fees. Those were my options. However, if I chose to open an investigation, I was told, the late fees would not be waived.Exhausted from dealing with Sallie Mae and their constant predatory practices (i.e., calling every 15 minutes of every day for 75 days, denying receipt of the forbearance request, acknowledging receipt of the forbearance request but stating that some other department would have to call me back, the other department never calling me back, and Sallie Mae suggesting that my account was already reported to the collection agency even though I had followed Sallie Mae's procedure for forbearance request to the letter) I was forced to set up payment arrangements.The manager explained my options. Considering Sallie Mae's dishonest practices thus far, I asked him to email those options to me in writing. He said he would. After entering into a repayment agreement with Sallie Mae, I was told that the manager ""was not allowed and could not personally email borrowers and the only thing I would receive from Sallie Mae would come from ""a receptionist"" and would be ""the form for forbearance"".Essentially, Sallie Mae explained, I had entered into a ""retro"" forbearance but the manager could not email me the arrangements he had made with me and had promised to email me in writing. Now, I am terrified that I just entered into a repayment with Sallie Mae but they will not keep the repayment agreement they promised to me over the phone.I have other student loans with Wachovia, CFI, and Citibank. At one time or another, I have entered into forbearance with them without any problems. Sallie Mae is a company that is not to be trusted. Sallie Mae is a company that lies to its borrowers. Sallie Mae is a company that practices predatory methods against their borrowers. If you have a choice of student loan companies, don't borrow from Sallie Mae."
2010-02-10 03:09:03,"Walden, NY",Frank,,"When I first applied to college, during the Clinton Era, I decided to take advantage of some student loans in order to get myself through college.  After applying for student aid, I was offered some loans and applied through Key Bank, which was my primary bank for many years at the time.  I was led to believe that I didn't have to pay them back until after I got out of college.  The told me to sign here and there and I was given money for college, books, and some living expenses. I was under the impression that the loans would be with Key Bank, but eventually, they ended up in the hands of Sallie Mae, without my permission or without my knowledge.  Of course, no one tells you that your loans would be sold off to someone else.  During my college experience, I was working full time and going to college full time.  I assumed that I would get out and get a good paying job.  No one ever tells you that 8.125% is a really high interest rate or that you will have really high payments once you are done.The financial aid office almost pushed me into the loans with minimal counsel, and never explained how costly it will be when I was finished and all of the loans (which are all individual loans, like 2 or 3 per year for 4 years) will add up to a lot of money.  By the time I was done with college, I had like 10 separate loans and had to keep track of each of them.So I finish my final year and it's time to pay back my loans.  I have 10 loans for 10 years adding up to $40,000 with payments adding up to $500-$600 per month.  Then, after finishing my education, having a job that pays $7 an hour cooking, I find myself in a situation that I could not reconcile.  I soon realized, I can't afford my payments so I asked for a forbearance.  Twelve months go by, I get a better job and payments resume. I soon realize that I still can't afford to pay this loan back so I call Sallie Mae for help with my problem.  So what solution do they offer me?  They tell me that they can lower my monthly payments and by consolidating all of my loans into one loan with a Flex loan consolidation.  They make it seem so simple and it seems to take a burden off my chest.  Soon, I am making a payment half of what I was paying before, except I just added 15 years to my term. Ten years later (when I should have originally been paid off), I find that I am running into problems making payments again because I was injured and out of work for a while.  I asked for a hardship deferment, but the rep from India will not have any of it.  He could not care less for my circumstances and tell me that I am not eligible and tells me that I need to make my payments.Three months later, I am behind in my payments and I get a call from the collection arm of Sallie Mae.  This time, I speak to an American who offers me forbearance for a few months since I have 45 months' worth.  I accept.  She tells me that I can either pay the interest or let it carry over.  I ask what the payments will be to pay the interest and they tell me that they don't know--but should go online the next day and it will tell me.I check online and find that my payments are about half of what my normal payments would be.  I then find that my principal balance is $41,000.  What?  I have been paying this loan for ten years and the principal has actually gone up, not down.  I then tried to call other loan companies to try and refinance, but they told me that they cannot help me because I have already consolidated and that Sallie Mae will never sell a loan that has been consolidated because they have a special agreement with the federal government that allows them to not allow the customer to refinance when the rates have dropped.  The rates were just over 3%.  I was floored and it was the last straw. Sallie Mae has taken complete advantage of me and my financial situations.  I feel that they are nothing short of loan sharks and the financial aid offices of both colleges I attended are not preparing students for the actual burdens of repayment.  It sort of reminds me of buying a car and then being rushed into buying a whole bunch of options and upgrades that you can't afford.  At least with buying a car, you know what your payments will be and for how long."
2010-02-09 16:47:45,"Lodi, NJ",Ivette,,"On January 19, 2010, I paid two student loans in full with a consolidation loan from Wells Fargo.  The total was $74,627.46.  I had an overpayment of $1,315.46 which I have been trying to track down by calling Sallie Mae.  I have spent endless hours on the phone with representatives from the Philippines, India and the US and no one can tell me where this money is.I have been told it was sent to the student by check, then I was told it was wired to the bank, then I was told it was sent to me.  Now, I am being told that it was sent to the bank via check and they are not able to provide me with a check number so that Wells Fargo can track it.  Sallie Mae is not providing adequate customer service and their international offices don't have a clue what it means to provide customer service.  I have spent numerous hours on the phone trying to get answers which have not been answered.  I am stressed every time I get off the phone with them because I can understand how it is possible for them not to have access to this information."
2010-02-09 05:07:14,"Sayre, PA",Lindsay,,"I'm only a couple of months into repaying the loans I borrowed from Sallie Mae, and already I'm experiencing difficulties. I pay online with my checking account. In January, I paid my bill online and received confirmation via SallieMae.com and via email that the payment went through. I checked my bank account and saw that the money for the bill hadn't been withdrawn, so I sent it again online since it was already two days delinquent. This time, SallieMae.com specifically said I had no outstanding balance and my next payment date was in February. Three weeks later, a Sallie Mae representative called me to tell me I was three weeks delinquent on my January bill. I explained to this man that I did submit payment more than once and did not know it failed to go through the second time since their website said I paid it. Somehow, neither payment got processed. The man I spoke to allowed me to pay for my bill via phone and removed the late fees, and also informed me what my February bill would cost.I just paid my bill for this month on time and it was about $100 higher than what I was told it'd be. Another lie on their part, aside from the website. I do not appreciate being lied to about my bills, especially since my mother is my cosigner and I don't want collection agencies breathing down her neck because Sallie Mae is incompetent. If Sallie Mae can't be bothered to get their payment methods to work, I assume that means they must not want to be repaid too badly. Trust me, I would have no complaints about not needing to repay $74000+ in loans. It's too bad more people don't seek legal action against Sallie Mae for their very frequent mistakes. I have a feeling they'd learn to do things properly right quick if they had a bunch of angry former students suing them left and right. My advice? Don't use Sallie Mae if you're looking into higher education. They charge unimaginable interest rates that end up doubling the initial loan amount (my original total from several loans was about $32,000. What I need to repay is $74,000). I'm having a hard time finding not only work in my field, but work in general. Sallie Mae's inability to make their online payment methods work puts me at risk for late fees and whatever caused my monthly payment to go up. This is going to make my savings dry up a lot faster."
2010-02-09 04:14:32,"Lake Mary, FL",Micael,,"Back in 2001, I was given a private student loan for a 1 year program at Orlando Culinary Academy. I was told by the financial help rep that my payments would not exceed $240/month. After graduation, I received a repayment plan from Sallie Mae and they were asking for over $500/month, as I couldn't pay that amount Sallie Mae advised me (poorly) to apply for a forbearance which I did. Once the forbearance period was over Sallie Mae sent me a repayment plan, which was over $900/month. I called Sallie Mae, was put on hold for over 3 hours, juggled from rep to rep, and then finally a rude, careless person told me that she didn't care if I could pay or not and then hung up the phone. I had to have my wife co-sign, Sallie Mae destroyed both our credit which we worked hard to keep good. Finally, Sallie Mae put me in a repayment program with a 8.75% interest. The loan amount is $35000 and by the end of the 30 year repayment plan, I will have paid $245000. In the 5 years, I have paid these legit crooks about $30000, and only $900 went toward the principle. I wish that these thieves would at least reduce their interest rates and offer a fixed rate to students with private loans.Sallie Mae ruined our credit. My wife and I were unable to purchase a car or a house which requires a good credit score. We are emotionally drained from this experience and disappointed that such a big corporation (Sallie Mae) is allowed to take advantage of misinformed students, knowing that they have no other option. I strongly believe that the image that Sallie Mae represents is negatively impacting prospective students' desire to acquire a higher education."
2010-02-05 18:39:12,"Magnolia, NJ",Joselyn,,"Before interest and ridiculous fees that were tacked on, I owe about $99,000. I have been out of school since 2006 and was granted the 6 months grace period. Because the job market for prospective college graduates was sub-par, I ended up working retail at minimum wage. Because I could not afford the then $1600/month payment (that is a mortgage on a nice house), I put my loans into forbearance, which over a few months cost $150 each time. Eventually, I exhausted the amount of times I could put my loans in forbearance. By 2007, they were telling me there was nothing they could do to reduce my monthly payment. They always find some sort of way to allow me to pay the $150 payment, which now only lasts 1-3 months, sometimes only a month, and it doesn't even cover all your loan amounts! They harass my 92 year old great uncle who is my co-signer who has a weak heart. My mom is now trying to see if she can make arrangements to have them contact her for my great-uncle's loan so they stop harassing him with worry. They keep saying the best they can do is lower my monthly private loan payment to $700 (my mother would handle 100 of this for my great-uncle's loan). Over the past year, I have been making payments on the federal loans (138 a month), which is still difficult for me. Before this kicked in, I was having this amount applied to two of my private loans until they started taking out for my govt loans). I can't afford any more than this. I make a car payment so I can get to work (unfortunately, public transportation is not an option), pay for gas in this rough economy, pay $300 a month rent in a shoddy apartment, pay car insurance, pay to eat so I can survive as I am Type 1 diabetic and can't starve myself or I will die. Which brings me to my next point: I have to pay for insulin and supplies too so I can survive and pay copays to go to the doctor, I am doing the best I can. I was in a car accident 3 years ago in a used car that I bought so it's not even like its a BMW or Mercedes and can't afford the get it fixed because I am paying my bills I need to survive. On top of that, I went on medication for anxiety because I started having panic attacks and crying every night because Sallie Mae would harass me nightly (another cost that could go toward my loans)... the icing on the cake was a supervisor harassing me about making a car payment when I owe them money! How about I stop making the payment of my car so they take it away and I can't get to work? Then how will they get paid, with peanuts? Or maybe they will just take my unemployment if the case need be because they only care about feeding their families. Last night while in a not so depressed mood, I called to talk to someone, it was a female, and she also harassed me about making a car payment and that she knows my dynamic and that I am talking rude to her, even though she was speaking condescendingly to me (a form of rudeness). She then proceeded to say how dare I speak to her in such a way and that I needed to pay what I was responsible for because she needed to get paid. Wow. Do you know how I ended the conversation? ""I read somewhere that the only thing to forgive student loan debt is death. Well perhaps you guys will start thinking about that."" I mean think about it, people who are depressed and suicidal because of what Sallie Mae does to these people? Then maybe something will be done about it."
2010-02-04 02:52:09,"Canby, OR",Sherrie,,"My son obtained a student loan from Sallie Mae years ago. He never did finish school due to the September 11 incident that happened. He had joined the military prior and was asked to leave school to attend boot camp. After boot camp, he then went off to combat training. After he left school, the loan became payable at that time. My son gave me rights to obtain any information about the loan, so that I could take care of it while he was away. I was told to put the loan in deferment, and the cost for that would be $50.00. So I did so. To make a long story short, through the hardship of my son's circumstances, I began to help out with payments and dealing with Sallie Mae directly. My most recent experience with them was that they would take payments out of my checking account automatically, and it would eventually bring us current which should have been this past Friday. I received a phone call from my father-in-law who was a cosigner on the loan. Through the events of him receiving 10 phone calls a day to only get a recorder asking them to hold which time after time left him holding only to reach no one on the other end. Not to mention the threatening letters that he has received through the mail. This results in him calling me to let me know that the harassment has started up again and that if I could please take care of it. I then phoned Sallie Mae, and they told me it is a generated letter that is sent out automatically and will stop once the account is current but not to worry about them since arrangements have been made. I would then call back my father-in-law who at that point was extremely worried due to the fact that he is on a low fixed income and is attending to my sickly mother-in-law. After my last conversation with my father-in-law, I was told that the phone calls have started up again and a payment was just taken out of my account 5 days prior which should have been the final payment to bring the account current. I phoned Sallie Mae immediately and spoke to a representative who told me that I was not authorized to receive any information regarding the loan. I asked for a manager and told him how this could be, for I have been dealing with them monthly now for all most a year. He said he would not give me any info, but if I would like to make a payment, he would be happy to take it.I insisted to speak to a manager. The manager who came to the phone was named Joe. We went back and forth for sometime. He then told me that all he could tell me was that what I was telling him was incorrect information and it was not true that the account was no longer delinquent and that the other reps who worked with me should not have given me any information and it was illegal to do so. I was frustrated and confused. I have note after note of those I spoke to, and now, I was being told this. He then told me that if we could get my son on the phone to give authorization, he then could give me the information I needed. We phoned my son, and he gave permission. But he hung up the phone with my son, and the representative advised me the information that I received was incorrect from the other reps and that the loan was in default.If I wanted to write him a $422.00 check, he would gladly take payment. He also mentioned that my son needed to send a fax giving me permission to receive further information about the account. I think we have had to send at least three faxes regarding the same issue through the years. Not to mention the lies, the harassment, and the complete confusion regarding this loan. If there is anyone who could help with the matter, I would be forever grateful. I did send an e-mail off to my state representative regarding this issue."
2010-02-03 05:51:14,"Orange, CA",Patty,,"My son went to UTI and we were told that the only way we could make payments to the school for his tuition was through using Sallie Mae. When the first payment was due for 1/3 of the tuition, I wrote the check out to UTI, but it was returned and told we had to go through Sallie Mae. That is where the nightmare began! That was in 2001.We continued making payments through out, but in May of 06, I kept getting these large amounts that they said we still owed. I was trying to talk to the Sallie Mae office and asked them to please explain these amounts they were claiming that we still owed, because after all the payments that we made, I felt something was just not right with their figures. They were so rude and nasty and would not communicate or listen to anything I was trying to explain to them. At that time I was going through a very difficult time with another matter in my life and I could not deal with it. So they told me that I would have to consolidate the loan amounts that they were claiming I still owed and that way I could put it into forbearance. So that is what I did.Finally in Sept. of 08, I contacted them again and this time I asked the Sallie Mae employee to please send me a complete payment history on our account because I felt something was just not right. So they did. After looking at it, I noticed that several of the large payments were not on there, so I contacted them explaining to them what I thought the problem was and could they please fix it. So the man that I was talking to told me at that time, that when I provided them proof of the canceled checks that I told him about, that it would clear up my account and it would be paid off and a zero balance. I asked him if he would send me documentation showing the paid off balance which he did and I got a document from them on Oct. 6, 08 showing exactly the zero balance as he said would be done.So I thought okay, that is all taken care of. Then all of a sudden I started getting all these harassing phone calls every day of the week, 2-3 times a day with rude and very nasty people from Sallie Mae saying I owed them all this money, and I explained my situation to them repeatedly but they would not listen.It is now Feb.2010, and they have now turned this into my credit score as a delinquent payment. It has ruined my credit score which has stopped me from getting a business loan. I have tried to call them and straighten it all out, but, I have gotten one person after another that lies, and tells a different story from one day to the next. It has ruined my life, ruined my business chances to get a loan so I can not further grow my business to earn a living, and caused me so much anxiety and stress that it gives me headaches constantly. I do not know what else I am supposed to do.Today, I tried calling them on and off all day to speak to the one supervisor that I faxed over my information to showing the documents that prove my balances were cleared, and ask again if they would please remove this off my credit score after they reviewed it from last week, so I can apply for a business loan, but I was told she is out of the office until next week. So I talked to another person and told them that I do not have time to wait for them to hold me up.It is a nightmare. It is not fair what they have been allowed to do to my credit score. It is clearly stated on the document their office sent me that my current account balance is zero. I did leave a message with the president of the company that is now in charge of this mess involving this Sallie Mae loan for my son. It is not fair what they have done, and it never should have been allowed to be put on my credit score as a delinquent account. This is not an ethically run or honest company to work with.What this has caused me by them putting this on my credit report as a delinquent account has stopped me from getting a business loan so I can take care of my business needs now. It is going to be a tremendous loss of money because I will not be able to have the products, brochures, and money to attend a trade show to meet with all the buyers in promoting my products. It will be a huge loss.Every day that goes by is money lost with potential buyers. It has caused me so much anxiety and stress it gives me headaches and stomach aches because of it. I worked so hard to build my business, and all I needed was a business loan, but this has prevented me from obtaining one. When I went to apply for my loan in Sept of 09, they told me it was because of this Sallie Mae account problem. Now, Sallie Mae told me that it did not go on my record until Dec of 09. That was one story from one lady, and today the story changed that it went on there in Nov. of 09. It makes you have nothing but headaches and stress. It has also caused anxiety with my personal relationships with my family because of the lies that have been told by Sallie Mae, it caused my son to be upset when I have had to ask him questions for correct information. It has all been very upsetting to go through."
2010-02-02 18:45:48,"Salt lake city, ut",Maddie,,"About six months ago, I started receiving frequent daily phone calls on my cell from two different numbers that I was unfamiliar with. I did not answer the calls. After about two weeks I got fed up and picked up the phone, and was met with an automated voice message. I hung up. The next time they called, I picked up and asked who was calling, and the call was dropped. I used an online search to find out who was calling me and found hundreds of complaints on the same number tree from a business called Sallie Mae. I have never heard of or used this company, and I don't know of anyone personally who has, therefore they have no reason to contact me. I have sent the company three emails telling them on no uncertain terms to stop the calls. The calls have not stopped. This is total harassment. I have nothing to do with this business and I have no idea how they got my number, but it needs to stop."
2010-02-02 18:43:22,"Coral Springs, FL",Julie,,"I am a teacher in the state of Florida. They have a program in which teachers that teach in critical shortage areas can have their student loan paid back if they qualify. This program goes year by year. I received a check from the state of Florida in the amount of $895.00 made out to Julie Davis and Sallie Mae on October 20th (approximately). I signed and sent the check to Sallie Mae along with a payment coupon and my account number written on the front. Sallie Mae cashed the check and did not credit my student loan account. I have been on the phone with them for three months. I received a copy of the cashed check from the state of Florida and faxed it to Sallie Mae. They still have not credited my account the $895.00. Now they are going to send me to collections although I am actually ahead of my payment schedule. I need someone to help me get my payment where it needs to be. Again, Sallie Mae cashed the check and I sent them a copy of the cashed check, but they still refuse to credit my account. I am a teacher and do not have the funds to hire an attorney."
2010-01-28 22:19:51,"Three Oaks, MI",Shannon,,"After I graduated, I had 6 months before having to start paying my loans. When I got a little behind and wanted to put my loans on hold, I had to talk to 10 people before they got it right. Not one of them knew what they were talking about. About 3 days later, when I thought I got it all taken cared of, I went to pay my personal loan payment. I had a late fee that was for the loans I had put on hold. I am very disappointed with Sallie Mae. I spent lots of time on the phone being switched from one person to another, and was stressed not knowing if they got it right or not."
2010-01-27 01:42:59,"Memphis, TN",T.,,"After graduating from college, I was unable to find a job for a while, and after finding one, I was laid off within 2 months. I was on unemployment and wasn't getting enough money to eat, let alone pay Sallie Mae. I contacted both Sallie Mae and the Department of Education (for a separate loan) to see what my options were. The Department of Education allowed me to put my loan in deferment. Sallie Mae, on the other hand, talked to me like I was dirt on a welcome mat. Then tried to charge me a fee (almost equal that of the payment) for forbearance. If I had that much money, I would have just made a payment! To make a long story short, it's been 6 months, they won't allow me to defer the loan, the forbearance fee has changed (still more than I can pay), and they called Monday and said my loan will be in default Friday. If they had told me before I got this loan that I could never qualify for deferment, I would've never gotten it. Please avoid Sallie Mae. They're quick to hand out a loan, but will not work with you when it's time for repayment. My credit will be forever ruined."
2010-01-26 20:17:46,"Staten island, ny",Gerald,,"My son went to Full Sail School of Music about 5 years ago. Since I could not afford to send him to school, he took out school loans and my wife and I co-signed for a few. We did not realize the impact it would cost us. The loans were given by Sallie Mae. The school he went to never really helped him get a job even though he graduated. He still has not got a job until this day. We have had calls from Sallie Mae continuously. To make this short, in 5 years, the loan has gone from $10,4000 to about $15,0000. I have tried to make deals but the money they want, I can't touch. I am going to be 65 and I am unemployed for a year now, no money in bank. I do have pension which gives me enough to pay my mortgage. My son Scot has been black marked by Sallie Mae so it is hard to get a job. My family just received a final notice that they want payments by end of month or they want full balance immediately plus 25% more will be added. There is no way out, we will never see daylight."
2010-01-26 05:16:56,"Indianapolis, IN",Paul,,"I was involved in a near death auto accident in Jan 2009 so my parents have been paying on their co-signed loans. We sent in payments and kept getting calls indicating that we were late and receiving late fees, additional interest and killing our credit. I called Sallie Mae and sent them proof that the payments for the past three months had in fact been made. It turns out that they were posted to the wrong account. As you can imagine, I asked ""whose account were the payments posted to?"" and after several minutes, I was told ""oh, it looks like it was posted to a closed account"". One, I don't have any closed accounts so they weren't posted to any account relating to me. Two, if it was posted to someone else's closed account, would that not mean that Sallie Mae would owe that person money for overpayment? What I'm really wondering is how many people are paying funds into Sallie Mae's ""ghost accounts""?My sister's loans, which I've been on top of and arguing about as well, have had similar issues in that all of her loans are in deferment except for the loan in which our mother co-signed and has been making payments on. It has been nearly a year and every two or three months, we get calls indicating that no payments have been made. Payments are made regularly but as it turns out, the one loan my mother co-signed for, Sallie Mae has been posting my mother's money to all of the other accounts my sister possesses except the only one that is currently not in deferment. So my mother has been paying on her financial obligation but Sallie Mae has been taking her money and applying to accounts that she has no responsibility for. I/We have spent countless hours speaking to dozens and dozens of customer service reps who claim to be able to resolve the issues but the issues keep returning. I would love to start a class action lawsuit if anyone else is having similar issues as these. I find it hard to believe that they aren't taking advantage of others in similar ways. They are eating, costing us additional late fees, credit reporting, interest on balances that have not had payments reported. I believe all of the hours and headaches due to their negligence ought to be compensated! It is a constant battle with Sallie Mae, this is just one occurrence, others have also been noted."
2010-01-22 19:44:25,"Seattle, WA",Ryan,,"They call me multiple times a day every day and if I talk to them one day, they still call me the next.  They called me twice before 8am today.  I called and let them know that they were in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA).  I also told them that they were in violation by calling me too much.When I got the loans to pay for college tuition and board, I thought that like federal loans, Sallie Mae would be income sensitive.  Now, they tell me that I don't make enough money to be put on a plan and if I don't pay, they will report me to creditors and send me into default.  I told them that I could afford to pay $50 a month.  She said that it was too little and that I will still go into default.When deferment costs $50 a loan and only last for three months, these loans aren't eligible for forbearance and nobody else can buy these loans, and I can't even file for bankruptcy to help me with these loans.  I feel like the only options are to let them destroy credit and ruin my life or hire a lawyer to fight for me. Somebody please help.  I want to pay off the loans but I just can't afford it.  I just wish the money wouldn't go to Sallie Mae.  They are awful.  I crawl further into debt.  What is a $22,000 could end up paying over $40,000.  I can't buy a new car, rent a new apartment, or even file for another loan.  I can't afford health insurance but I need it after having a panic attack in September.  I'm afraid the stress that Sallie Mae creates by calling everyday and threatening to ruin my credit will send me into more panic attacks leading to secondary discords like ulcers."
2010-01-22 09:07:23,"Bend, OR",Stephanie,,"My husband used Sallie Mae because that was the only company that his college would allow him to use. After his college was over, they started to harass him admittedly. It has been going on since I want to say for 2 years. It recently started getting worse a year ago during my pregnancy and caused a lot of grief for me as well. During this time, they had told him to steal money from me to pay off his loans (can you believe that!). He told them countless of times ""I will pay you when I can get a job, I'm not skipping out on this"". They also call us 5:00AM every morning when it clearly states they cannot call between the hours of 5-8.We've also complained on BBB a few times. But we came to find that the guy that runs Sallie Mae is actually getting complaints about Sallie Mae removed. He states that he trains all his employees personally and all these complaints are false. About a month after having our daughter, he started to get harassing phone calls from them. I told him to tell Sallie Mae, we had a 2-month old to worry about as well, after they told him that they threatened him that if he did not pay something bad was going to happen to our daughter. The nerve of a company to threaten a 2-month old child! My child. We live with his mother (my husband I mean) due to the fact that we don't have the means to move out on our own yet. So she got him to consolidate his loans. So he got a letter from Sallie Mae stating that his loans were paid in full by Direct loans. But now, Sallie Mae is harassing him again saying they never sent him a letter and that if he does not pay $12,500 soon, they are taking us to court. This caused my husband a severe panic attack. I don't know what to do anymore, they just won't stop. They still even harass my mother and she has paid off Sallie Mae 5 years ago for her college."
2010-01-19 07:47:09,"Wisconsin Rapids, WI",Rachel,,"In 2006 I decided to attend an online college- CTU Online for Project Management. I question if the online version of the school is accredited. It was too easy to get in. I could do a 2-year technical degree or a Bachelor's. I got different tuition expenses from different representatives on both sides, for the 2-year program. Anywhere from $14k up to $44k when I finished my program. I signed up for the 2-year technical program.Both sides assured me I could set up whatever convenient payment plan, whatever I could afford. The assignments were all posted via Message Boards. Of my 4 classes, they all had a final group project. In every class some group members dropped out. I could not reach two of my instructors or they never returned my calls and emails. The two that responded decided to have me do the full project! Four full group projects in 3 weeks! I could not finish the final projects. I failed and was removed from the college.It was less than three months after I was removed that Sallie Mae sent bills and called me up to 10x a day. I told them that I did not have a job and could not pay my loans. The first bill was for the books. Then the rest was for over $13k, the first semester!"
2010-01-14 16:28:15,"Upper Draby , PA",Mya,,"Sallie Mae is a rip off. They're making me pay a fee for a forebearance. I have contacted Wille **, a lawyer based out of Florida with experience taking down big corporations. Everyone should give him a call and see what he has to say about your situation."
2010-01-10 19:48:47,"Levittown, PA",Marisa,,"I wrote on here last month and will keep writing until someone feels the same way and wants to stop this horrible company form growing. They have the worst customer advocates I have ever spoken too. I was recently contacted by a woman named ""Rose"" who only would repeat to me ""terms and agreements"" over and over. No ""I'm sorry or lets see what we can do. Nothing. She was a broken record. I told her she wants getting the first months payment and thats it. I cannot send you money while my sister is in school and nor can she. They expect us to pay the interest which is $171 a month and then they expect us to use them next year. I have given them $12,000 in almost four years and my debt with them has not made a mark or a dent. Absurd. Their practice of talking to people is outlandish and Sallie Mae outsources so many jobs to India and other countries it makes me sick. Please read the stories of the other customers on this page and see the growing epidemic. It needs to stop."
2010-01-06 19:15:23,"Joliet, IL",Galaxia,,"I graduated from a master's program in 2008. I have a small business and work full time at another company. I can't afford my interest only payments and they refuse to help me at all. The representative at Sallie Mae told me to get another job after I told him I already work full time and own a business with 11 employees. I really feel that the government needs to regulate the private loan industry because just as the mortgage lending tactics were bad so are the private student loans lending. Realistically, there is no way a student should be allowed to get a loan for over $100,000. Sallie Mae is really making it impossible for me to survive because I will not be able to afford paying them anymore, which in turn will ruin my credit that I may need. I have always had good credit and for one lender to be this strict/non-negotiable will cause several of us to not pay at all."
2010-01-06 17:43:55,"Valparaiso, in",Michael,,"Several years ago, I co-signed for a student loan for my son. And now due to him having some problems, he is unable to make payments. So they, Sallie Mae, are now calling me several times a day from a few different offices. Each call in the past, I talked with them, giving them the same information each time that I am 68 years old, in poor health due to a major surgery this past July and on a fixed income due to disability. But the calls keep coming. I told them several times, if I could pay and help out my son, I would. If I have the money, I would hire an attorney to help me with this, but I don't. I have told them this several times, but the calls keep coming. What do I do now?"
2010-01-06 17:34:03,"Florien, LA",Mary,,"I have been fighting with Sallie Mae for over 2 years now. I have made numerous calls, emails, mailed letters, and faxed forms to them with little or no response. When my loan was nearing the end of its postponed payment status, I asked them to provide me with payment information. I was told I would be notified by mail when that was determined. I never received any notification, so I called them. They told me to contact Uniied Student Aid Funds. After repeated calls to them, a rep told me I had to contact Sallie Mae, so I did. After the repeated circle of calling in order to get information of the amount of my payment, I began sending in monthly payments of $90.00 a month and told them to figure out who I could talk to in order to get the information I needed. I increased my payment to $130 a month with still no contact from them. On December 31,2009, I received notice from the Treasury Department that I am in default of my loan, and they are going to take a percentage of my deceased husband's social security from me, because I refused to pay my debt. I have copies of all emails I sent them and all payments I have been making from my account. And I even have a copy of the payments Sallie Mae recorded as paid on my loan. Someone please tell me how I am in default when no one from Sallie Mae contacts you but you continue making payments. What options do I have to stop them from lying and ripping me off? I am at the point that I will just tell social security to stop making payments to me, as I do not feel Sallie Mae has the right to take money when they are receiving payments monthly already."
2010-01-04 02:22:04,"San antonio, tx",Mike,,"Please note this is a continuing problem with this company and has gone on for several years. Background: My estranged daughter had me co-sign a student loan back in 2001 for her. She took out other student loans in her own name with the same company. Since she defaulted on the loans, Sallie Mae began a campaign of harassment against me. I am only a co-signer for 1 loan for a total currently of $22,474.00 and the monthly payment should be $186.00. Every month, I send a check to the address on the bill they send (it took over a year to get them to send me a bill) for $250.00. Then they allow that money to be disbursed to all my daughter's student loans thus, resulting in the appearance that I am underpaying the loan. They then call almost monthly from the collections department. When you ask for a supervisor, someone gets on the phone, in this case it was a man calling himself Joe. When I asked for a last name, he said it was ** and when I asked him to review the long history on the computer, he began to get abusive and I hung up. I cannot deal with these guys any longer. It is amazing they can operate a financial institution this way. Please help."
2010-01-02 16:02:45,"Turbotville, PA",Jacklyn,,"I returned to school as a single mother, trying to better our lives, and leave dangerous situations behind us. I got a Tuition Answer loan from Sallie Mae to help cover the difference in school costs and living expenses. After I graduated, I was unable to find work. I received the paperwork for my loans via USPS mail forwarding. I contacted Sallie Mae and updated my information.For three months, they called and sent out mailings to friends and family, saying that they had no information for me; but they were calling me multiple times a day and talking to me the whole time. They even called me on my pre-paid cell phone, despite my requests for them to remove that number. The worse part, the letters that they sent out had my correct mailing address on them, and ended up in the hands of my ex--who used that information to find me and try to kill me.And when I complained to Sallie Mae about what happened, the representative told me that if I had just gotten a job and paid my bills, that wouldn't have happened. I eventually had the opportunity to clean a woman's house and barn for the deferment fee, which lasted only a few months. Now they are calling again, and can't understand why I can't find work, or pay over $500.00 a month. I'm willing to do anything for work, and they can't even do what they are paid to do. If I were able to add up all the time I spent on the phone dealing with their poor excuse for representatives, I probably would have lost several weeks of my life. Time that would have been better spent searching for a job, advancing my skills, or spending time with my special needs child."
2009-12-31 01:20:02,"Renton, WA",Candace,,"I, like many borrowers of Sallie Mae, am over my head in debt. Sallie Mae graciously lent $60,000 in private student loans to me well over 6 years ago. I often wonder why I ever chose to get higher education. Recently now at over $72,000, my monthly payment has jumped to $1008. I am currently on maternity leave bringing in no income and don't ever anticipate me being able to afford this amount when I go back to work. Sallie Mae has no grace. After explaining over and over again my living expenses on top of being away from work, I was told that since I have used ""interest only options"" prior, I now have no other choice than to pay the $1008 or extend my loan for another 10 years to lower my payment down to a $489 monthly option. Of course, I could do a deferment for three months but what good will that do me? I'll still be in the same situation in three months. The numbers just do not pencil out. Mortgage + insurance + car payment + medical bills + living ... I am so discouraged. I don't know where to turn. When will this cycle end?"
2009-12-30 03:10:41,"Levittown, PA",Marisa,,"Oh Sallie Mae. How you rob young people blind and then affect the rest of our lives. I am a current Sallie Mae user because it was what the loan company suggested. As a naive individual and not in tune with loans and repaying them, I was sucked in to an interest rate that was too high and having to pay back double the loan. I find that to be loan sharking at its finest. Now my sister used them because they were the company I used and willing to give out money. Unfortunately with my sister, they took over 3 months to process all the paperwork. She signed up for their amazing (sarcasm) Smart Option Loan, which was not explained at all. Just told to fill out that loan over and over again. They took so long because they lost info, stated there was missing info and miscommunication from every representative that works there. But that can be continued later. Her loan was for $18,000 because Sallie Mae took so long and her school issued a late fee, so we had to take more money. Oh how joyous they are. Well a few days ago, my sister received a statement asking her to pay $171.44 a month while she is in school. They changed the agreement during the process. No wonder why they prolonged everything. I called Sallie Mae (because I was the gracious sister to co-sign) and complained how come they have some nerve to charge money during school. I can't pay it because I give Sallie Mae enough money. My parents can't because who can nowadays? All they could tell me was the Smart Option Loan was the only loan option they had. I asked what happened to the Signature Loan they had and not having to pay until 6 months after graduation. They conveniently do not offer it anymore. Such a large company and multimillion dollar company and such great service. Not. No one ever knows what they are doing and most are not from America. I don't begrudge people for working, but when you can't understand someone and they are not trained, it makes it real hard to get things accomplished. I have been told I was given wrong information, but only was told that same information days earlier.This company is a disgrace and a poor representation for America and the people that work there. My sister's loan is $33,000 after being paid back. How is anyone supposed to survive after college? Apparently with Sallie Mae, it's not possible and with a poor economy, it doesn't make it any easier. Someone needs to look deep into this company and find out why they can charge the high interest rates and charge the payments they do. I'd rather stimulate the economy by buying a house, but that won't happen. I'm 25 years old and student loan poor. I think that these private loan companies are abusing people and blinding them. I'm paying Sallie Mae my mortgage. A $60,000 loan for me has become $120,000+. I hope that if you read this, to never use this company ever. They have no couth, are not customer service friendly and they don't care if you suffer with any other bills or just scrape to get buy. They want their money and that's it. Too much money is the problem."
2009-12-29 18:32:11,"Duncaville, TX",Cynthia,,"Sallie Mae is not customer friendly and they are loan sharking. They send out notice of payments that have different amounts due each notice. I call into the call center and hold the line for 30 min. or longer. At times the phone hangs up, then I have to call back in and wait. No payment option is provided. There are no work out plans!  Customer rep stated that they are mailing out paperwork that never make it. For example, I have been calling since Oct. about payment options. I have been refused payment options. I stated that I just started a new job and I am unable to make payments right now. A customer rep was supposed to mail me out papers on 12-17-09. I never received them, so I called on 12-22-09, but my payment was due on 12-27-09. I did not receive the paper work until 12-25-09. Plus, I called the 888 number on 12-26-09; the customer care center was closed. The automotive service stated that my payment was late and it had assessed late fees! My payment was not due until 12-27-09. Plus, they stated that the current payment of $897 was due immediately to bring account current.This is retaliatory practice because I filed a complaint before. I'm unable to use debit card to make payments. Must I give checking or savings account information? If I use the automotive service, a $14.95 fee is charged? Customer rep can take your payment over the phone for a $14.95 charge? If I make a payment online, the only account I can use is my savings or checking? Plus, I am disputing Sallie Mae on the number of payments that I made in early 2000 and something.Why are they charging me interest on money that was sent back? Payments that were paid off suddenly reappeared. Sallie Mae never settled my dispute of false reporting to the credit bureau. I was unemployed and submitted paper work and someone neglected to do their jobs. They found the error, but never corrected it!This is another housing crisis. Sallie Mae has used every excuse not to offer me a loan forgiveness. I worked at a charter school as a teacher and principal. I work as a mental health worker. I was from a low income household yet my interest rates were outrageous."
2009-12-24 02:03:26,"Stephens City, VA",Steve,,"I co-signed a Smart Option Loan for my son in August 2009, which is for him to pay monthly interest only until 6 months after he graduates. Less than 3 months into the loan, Sallie Mae decided to change the rules and start requiring principal payments as well - which of course he can't make and is in complete violation of the Truth In Lending Agreement, which is a legal document for both parties. While making multiple calls to their customer service lines all over the world including the Philippines, India and the US, everyone agreed that Sallie Mae screwed up and apologized for the inconvenience. Nothing has been corrected back to the original agreement. Meanwhile, my son's loan shows delinquent, they have assessed a late fee and they bumped the interest rate by 1/4%. My son made his first 3 monthly interest payments as agreed on time, but because of their pathetic customer service procedures, they cannot get this fixed and live up to their end of the agreement. I know that I am not the only person having this experience with Sallie Mae. It blows my mind that they are allowed to get away with their practices and make people's lives miserable. I pride myself with my credit rating and have instilled good credit practices for my children. Usually, after 1 or 2 calls about clearing up issues with companies is all that is required, but not with Sallie Mae. I have placed at least 10 calls. They all agree that Sallie Mae made a mistake by changing the agreement; that my son kept his end of the agreement; made his interest payments; and made them on time. But because of their incompetence, he shows delinquent and is getting charged fees and bumping his interest rate. It has turned out to be a horrible nightmare. I can't believe that a company continues to operate like this in this country. I know there are a lot of deadbeats out there that will blame loan companies when the problem is probably themselves, but that is not my case. Somebody out there needs to help the honest people in dealing with corrupt and unethical companies like Sallie Mae."
2009-12-22 21:51:55,"Elmhurst, NY",Danny,,"I went to Katherine Gibbs School here in New York City. I finally got what I thought was a legitimate two year degree in Visual Communications. Until I found out that it's not a legitimate degree and it's been verified by CUNY as a non-accredited college. Now for all my trouble I'm stuck with a loan, that I have no money to pay for. They consistently harass me six days a week, call five or more times a day. I got one of them trying to act friendly to me as if he was really trying to help me. I recently had to borrow some money to give them something and guess what, they want more. Today, I received a letter from them via UPS saying that if I don't pay, I'll go in default and whatnot if I don't give them more money. I've been reading stories of fellow students who attended the same school and people who have borrowed from this company and it's an absolute disgrace that they aren't out of business. They should be sued for what they're doing not only to myself, a minority, but also people who have no money. That's their business is to prey on the weak economic class so they would own them like slaves. The money we work so hard for going to them without having to break a sweat or worry about where our next meal will be coming from. These people are out to do one thing and it's destroying our lives. The ignorant people, who are employed by them, don't care about the suffering we go through on a daily basis trying to make ends meet. I talked to the supervisor who is pompous and rude and told him that my money feeds his family and he just shrugged it all off and flat out didn't care. I had to hang up on him, because I was tired of hearing the garbage that was coming out of his mouth. So much so that I had to curse him out and it's not the only time it's happened with these people at Sallie Mae. They're so ignorant that they think that the fifty times they call a week isn't harassment. Under legal channels, it is harassment. I've kept all their mailings as proof and I'm sure there are many people like me who are doing so as well in hopes of legal action against them. This company just makes me so upset, so much so that when I'm happy and they call, I get all riled up and angry. I'm losing my peace of mind because they will not stop doing this to me or other people. This is wrong. This company is without a doubt evil. They have to be stopped."
2009-12-18 18:11:19,"Corpus Christi, TX",Shirley,,"Sallie Mae extorts money - end of story. They tell me they charge 10% interest per day (like that's going to make you want to pay them when you don't have the funds to even pay them $1 a day). I co-signed loans for my son. At the time he graduated, there were no jobs, and still there are not any jobs using his degree so he is waiting tables to make ends meet. Does Sallie Mae care? No they don't. I went through a financially devastating divorce and now they are after me - do I have to funds to pay? No, I don't. I offered them what I could pay and they said no dice. They are the true scum of the earth and their collection people are very rude. In my opinion, charging 10% per day is extortion."
2009-12-10 23:59:40,"Redlands, CA",Keith,,"This company is impossible to deal with. I have several loans with Sallie Mae and, like everyone else, I have trouble making the $700 a month payment program they have set up. After all, I just graduated and you don't see me driving a BMW. So they changed the program to $300 a month interest only, which I still have trouble making, but I sacrifice food and other necessities to accommodate for these shylocks. The biggest problem I have with Sallie Mae is their customer service is horrible. Horrible! I used to work telephone customer service and we always lived by the maxim, one call resolution. These guys are really bad, and you can tell the company doesn't care about training. I spoke to at least 50-75 reps and each one was about as helpful as a rock. It's like they take classes to be unhelpful. And when you do find someone helpful (twice for me), the next time you call back, it's like calling for the first time. My wife just called 5 minutes ago, and said all I have to do is approve a plan setup, yet when I call back, they change the plan and say they don't know what I'm talking about.They say the conversations are recorded for customer service purposes. I'd like to get my hands on a few of those tapes and take these guys to court. I know I borrowed the money for education, and I plan on paying it back, but these guys are shylocks to the fullest extent. Anyone reading this, don't go through Sallie Mae if you can avoid it. They are strictly a for-profit company and will destroy your life if you have trouble making payments!"
2009-12-10 20:10:16,"Blue Ridge Summit, PA",Jamie,,"My co-signer and I became unemployed about 3-4 months ago. I called for a forbearance on a private loan. My mother called about a forbearance and was told 1 month would be a fifty-dollar fee. That made no sense to me, so I called. I was told 3 months with a fifty-dollar fee and it would about 15 days for the paperwork to arrive.  After 20 days, no paperwork arrived. I called back and was told they could email it. Then he said, ""Oh, you have an ETCS(?) loan,"" and he could process it over the phone. I had to call back so I could move some money around for the fee. He noted it in my account. When I called back, I got disconnected or hung up on at least 4 times. I was sent to busy signals and dead air after the first transfer. The phone system could not understand my info.When I got a real person, I was told that I now had 2 late payments and it wouldn't cover it even though the second payment was because they didn't send the paperwork. A few other people there told me different things regarding a forbearance, and none were the same. I finally had enough and called their corporate number. I was going for the CEO but I couldn't find his number, lol. Here is Corporate's number in VA - (703) 810-3000. He transferred me to the Customer Advocate, which is based in the USA and only four people work in that department. I was helped quickly and now my loans are all set to February 2010. Here is the customer advocate number - 8885454199.I will only be calling those 2 numbers from now on. I cannot stand them and their scare tactics. They do not care about their customers, and do not want to help. This is not the first problem I have had with them. Money has been applied to wrong loans, payments haven't gone through. They call nonstop even after a payment has been made. No one should use this company unless of course you want to die early of stress. I still don't know why my 30,000-dollar loan won't be paid off till 2021 and it will be the cost of a Porsche when it's done. I asked for the loan agreement and 5 requests and 2 years later, there is nothing."
2009-12-10 15:29:43,"Indianapolis, IN",Tia,,"Wow! What crooks! I signed up for the 3 pay program. What was supposed to happen is, you give Sallie Mae your acct. # and then for three months they take out a certain amount of money and at the end of the three months, you will be brought current. During the three month, July, August, and September of 2009, I was receiving threatening letters saying I was going into default. Then I called every month and they assured me that ""everything was okay."" During this time, I asked for several ... several pieces of mail stating that I would be brought current, and I also asked them to send me something telling me when my monthly payments were due. I received nothing. I called at the end of September and spoke to a young man who told me not to worry. He said a supervisor would call me to set up my monthly payments and to make my account current. I did receive a call from a supervisor threatening me. Of course, I called back and explained that I had spoken to someone and they told me everything was okay, that the emails I received were system-generated. They then told me that I needed to pay something for the month of October. I did that, and they told me everything was okay. I received an email in Nov. telling me two of my student loans were going to default! I called again! By this time, I had spoken to several (6 or 7) supervisors. This was when I was referred to Joe **. He got on the phone telling me I only paid $20 in August and that was why my loans were going to default. I asked him to send me a copy of the statement and then he magically found the real amount I paid. Mr. ** and I have battled it out. He let me know that Sallie Mae doesn't have to send me any kind of bill in the mail. He told me I borrowed the money and I have to pay it back. Well, of course, I know that. So I then asked how much my monthly payments would be and he told me he didn't know; they would vary. Okay, so then I asked, ""How in the heck am I supposed to know when and how much to pay if you don't?"" Oh, it has been an awful and painful experience!"
2009-12-08 22:45:39,"Manchester, OTHER",Gillian,,"I have a consolidated private student loan and two federal consolidated loans with Sallie Mae since 2002. Originally, one of my private loans was cosigned with my grandmother before I consolidated. (Incidentally, on that loan I signed on a 4% rate and received an 8% rate on my second disbursement without ever accepting the change. At that point you're already enrolled and held hostage, right?) I consolidated the private loans some time ago and was assured my grandmother would no longer be cosigner. The reverse happened, now she is listed as a cosigner on all of my loans (at least that's the reason they give for harassing her). I am in school and repeatedly send in the paperwork for in school deferment only to have them lose it. The form is unavailable on their website by the way. I had to be transferred to India in order to have it emailed to me.If I am a few days late, my grandmother gets nasty phone calls where they tell her that I don't have the right to move away without paying my debts and that they don't know how to contact me. This is a lie as I am constantly calling them on the deferment issue and verifying my address and contact number every time. They even have additional contact numbers for me in the states to call before they call my grandmother. They are picking on an elderly lady because they know they can upset her and get to me. Why, I don't know? I'm doing the best I can and they have failed me every single time. When I called to complain about this issue, the representative hung up on me.Consequences: emotional stress and harassment to my grandmother, unnecessary accruing interest while I should be in school deferred. God knows what interest related to the rate switch. Unfair late charges due to misapplied payments, financial hardship from having to maintain payments while paying for my new education (out of pocket this time!)."
2009-12-08 20:27:59,"Avon Lake, OH",Patricia,,"I co-signed a loan for my nephew several years ago. He has been servicing his debts for 3 years now, but has fallen victim to the H1N1 flu. He has been hospitalized and in a state of unconsciousness for two weeks. I have tried calling and emailing Sallie Mae to make payment arrangements on his accounts. They will not speak to me - even about the loan to which I am legally liable should my nephew not regain consciousness! This company should be dissolved and the loans purchased by real lenders with a real ability to actually serve in a servicing capacity. I can think of no other company that treats its customers so poorly, provides so little value for the cost of its ""service"", and continues to survive. Isn't there anything we can do to stop this monstrosity from continuing?"
2009-12-02 23:05:44,"Bellefontaine, OH",Carolyn,,"My son is attending DeVry in Columbus, Ohio, and is scheduled to graduate in 2011. DeVry set him up with Sallie Mae, and I co-signed a loan for $17,000.00 at 3.25% on 8-2007. In May 5, 2009, we got a $4,700.00 loan. But when we found out that they were charging 11.85% interest and that he would have to pay back $14,900.00, I borrowed money at a better interest rate and paid it off in July. They put $300.00 on it in June, and in July, I paid as requested, $4,772.99, of which they put $136.02 on the aforementioned loan. I found out I was going to get laid off. So I started paying on the first student loan in Feb. 2009 that I co-signed, and in Aug. 2009, I paid $300.00 and it hasn't been applied to the $17,000.00 yet. I have called and e-mailed since Sept., and they said they have it and four different people have turned in a request to have it applied but it hasn't been. While researching this, I found that back in March 2009 I sent $500.00 in, and only $62.50 was applied to the only loan I have with them. The checks only have my name on them and not my son's. They said that they applied the money on my son's other accounts. How can they take my money and put it on someone elses account? They wouldn't let me see his account until I got permission, but they can put my money on his account without my permission? They have my money, and I am still getting charged interest on the loan when they have $737.50 of mine that hasn't been applied to my account; back in March, $436.50; and in August, $300.00. All together for the first loan of $17,000.00 at 3.25%, I have sent in $3,036.02, and they say we still owe $16,304.92. I have called and complained about the money that they have cashed from my checking account and have not applied to my account. They even asked for a copy of the cancelled check (front and back). This tells me that they don't have the check. Someone at Sallie Mae cashed the check for it to show up on my checking account. They have been giving me the runaround all this time. Today, they sent an e-mail with the account information and told me all I have to do is simply log on to the account and I could see this. That's how I found out about the March payment of $500.00 with only $62.50 being applied to my account. For August payment, they still don't show that they ever received it, but my bank activity shows that they cashed in on 8-11-09. Banks like this one gives others a bad name. Can anyone help me with this?"
2009-12-02 21:43:12,"Kekaha, HI",Michelle,,"They continue to use my social security as an account number. They scream at me and don't let me talk. They won't let me file a deferment even though I have been laid off from my job. I filed bankruptcy and lost my house this year. They don't care! My BK was discharged on July 15. They said my payment is past due and has been for 6 months, but yet I never get a letter in the mail saying that. I just keep struggling to pay the $50 month and they keep calling me saying I am past due, yet the paper I get in the mail says please pay $50, so I do. I can't win. They are Nazis. I am struggling to rebuild my credit. And because of the carelessness and improper billing practices, I just kept paying what the paper statement told me to pay. All the while they had me as behind 30 days, yet never put that on the paperwork."
2009-11-25 18:45:53,"Ludlow, MA",Maria,,"My son took out a student loan for college for which I co-signed. He has not been able to get a full time job. I'm a single parent with a full time job. However, after my mortgage, insurance, utilities, etc. sometimes the payments are a bit late. I have explained this to Sallie Mae repeatedly. They call every day, 2 or 3 times per day. I tell them the same thing. I will pay the loan by a certain date. They still call every day. I explain the same thing to them every single day. I don't dispute the loan, I promise to pay by a certain date. Today, after I spoke to them last night to let them know I was going to pay it today, they called me at work! If this isn't harassment, I don't know what is."
2009-11-18 21:26:16,"Providence, RI",Sandra,,"My student loan was transferred to Sallie Mae. At the time, I was paying $50 per month for my student loans. Once Sallie Mae got a hold of my loan, they started charging me over $230 per month. I cannot afford to pay that much per month. I have a son I pay child support for as well as rent, food, car insurance, and other bills. I cannot afford to pay that much. I tried several times to have them lower the payments, but they said that its too late for that. I filled out the paper to lower my payments and they said I wasn't approved for it because it was too late. They have put my loan on forbearance a few times but whats the point? I can't afford their monthly charge. Because of this situation, I can't further my education. I'm afraid my income tax will be taken and my wage garnished. I live paycheck to paycheck and I can't get a second job due to the bad economy. I am single and can't afford to live. I am constantly stressed out with this situation which has no resolution. I can only afford $50 per month. I need help."
2009-11-16 20:28:16,"Orlando, FL",Marcos,,"I'm a current senior college student in Florida. I started to get student loans to at least get an education and not be part of the fallen ones with frustration. But after several years, Sallie Mae has become a monster. I have a couple of loans that I have to start paying six months after graduation. Recently, I started receiving calls that I owe $321 and I'm delinquent 33 days. I told the lady that I'm still in school and that Ill be graduating in eight months. She said that out of the loans I had, there was one that I had to start paying while Im in school. I said, Why would you guys call me 33 days after the due date and tell me that I'm late? Of course, they want to get some late fees, but 33 days?! Anyway, after I picked up the first call, there had been numerous calls harassing me saying that I owe, that Im in the internal collection files, and in 33 days more, I will be at the real collection agency. This is unreal. After receiving all these calls, I spoke to customer service and explained what was going on. I told her that I will talk to the school and try to get this fixed and that it could be a mistake and to please stop calling until I go to the school. The lady said, ""Sir, this not your school's problem. This is your problem. Are you going to take care of this? Oh, that's right! People who dont know Sallie Mae, Sallie Mae has a customer service line where they can be nice with you and they have a collection line where they call, put you on hold, ask you questions, and then treat you like CACA. I couldnt agree more with these people complaining about this company. Our economy is tough and monsters like Sallie Mae are not making it easy. Unfortunately, this is a major issue and the government needs to get involved because this is one of the big factors why our economy is the way it is. I bet if I told my four friends about Sallie Maes behavior, they will step back and not go to school. Not very smart, right!? But I, like a good friend, feel like I have to say it and advise them."
2009-11-16 02:56:32,"Trenton, MI",Corrine,,"I have had numerous problems with Sallie Mae since graduating college. I have 40,000 dollars in student loans from this company, and upon graduating, I was unable to obtain a job in my field within the ""grace period"". I have spoken to several people over the course of the past year, and every time I go to put my loan in forbearance, something happens. Either my money is taken and put towards the loan itself, or the money is taken from my account, but Sallie Mae has no account of receiving the money (coincidental, I suppose), or the person on the other end lies to me and tells me my forbearance has actually gone through, and that I am in the clear (which in fact was a big fat lie and my loan accrued over $2,000 in late charges that are currently being tacked to the end of my loan).Anyways, after feeling like I am the only one in the world dealing with this huge monster, I did some homework. It seems like 80 percent of the people who have loans through Sallie Mae are unhappy, disgruntled and harassed. I am taking a stand not only for myself, but for everyone who has, and is currently having problems with Sallie Mae. I have started to piece together a book with not only my accounts and hardships with Sallie Mae, but that of many others. My goal is to educate the public on what they do to people so that our youth will choose to go through other loan providers. It's stressful enough finding jobs in this economy. Sallie Mae will drive a normal person insane.Please feel free to email your stories to me. You can choose to make up a fake name, use your real name, or not give me a name at all."
2009-11-11 17:17:47,"West Liberty, KY",Stephen,,"After multiple issues with Sallie Mae, we decided to obtain a local bank loan to pay them off entirely. Sallie Mae signed for the certified mail containing a bank check in the amount of $12,884.78. They only posted $2,884.78. Calling the 888 customer service line resulted in no correction of their mistake."
2009-10-30 19:23:38,"La Puente, CA",Marcy,,"Sallie Mae is unfair in their practices and consumers need to be aware! My problem started back in July when I injured my back at work. From July to Sept., I paid my student loan payments on time but in late September, bills started to pile up and I found myself with not enough money to cover my Oct. 5th payment of $639.00. So on Sept. 29, 2009, I faxed in a forbearance form and paid a $50 forbearance fee. The Sallie Mae policy for forbearance stated that I be current and pay the prior month payment (which I had done!) to qualify for a forbearance. Fourteen days later on Oct. 14th, I called Sallie Mae after hearing no response from them regarding the forbearance. To my shock, the fax number on the forbearance form is incorrect!They went on to tell me that no application was received and no forbearance had been processed. The rep then went on to tell me to simply fax the application yet again and everything would be taken care of. On Oct. 20, after still hearing no response, I called Sallie Mae yet again. Now I am yet again shocked to be told my forbearance was denied because now, my payment from Oct. 5th was past due!After I explained that I was on worker's comp and was going to have back surgery and really needed the forbearance, the rep told me to fax a written letter stating my situation and copies of all the fax confirmations from previous faxes for consideration, and wait yet again! There was still no response from Sallie Mae so I called on Oct. 20th. I spoke with someone else who said he would email the forbearance department (since no one could talk to the forbearance dept. directly) to take a second look at my forbearance because according to this rep, I have 10 days grace and had until Oct. 15 to be officially ""past due"" and I faxed the second forbearance application on Oct. 14th. He said to give them a week to process so I waited yet again. Meanwhile, I was contacted by a ""Collections"" rep who was rude and mean! when I tried to explain the whole mix up with the forbearance, she told me ""I will mute your call, so that I can tell you no forbearance will be processed because you are past due!"" After that, she would not listen to anything I had to say. Eventually after trying and trying to get a payment out of me, she told me, ""I will mark you account as ""refused to pay and refer to ombudsman!"" Then she went on to hang upon me! I never refused to pay, I simply wanted help with the forbearance for 3 months and no one wanted to help! Right now, I get so many collection calls that I am looking to change my phone number! So today, Oct. 29th, I called Sallie Mae for an update to the email back on the 20th, and I was told that nothing came of that email and I was told for the 2 millionth time that because I was past due, I would not get a forbearance! I thought a forbearance was for those times I cannot pay so can someone please explain to me why I have to be current to get approved?! So today, I borrowed from my elderly father (also my co-signer) to make the payment. Now Sallie Mae is happy but I'm left here in tears with not even enough money to live on. My next payment is due on Nov. 5th and I applied for forbearance again today after making the payment! I was assured that this forbearance will be processed but I will just have to wait again! I wanted to make all this known, because I wish I would have read the posts on this site before taking out a loan with Sallie Mae! I just want others to know my story and to know, don't do any business with Sallie Mae because they are unfair and the government should put a stop to them!"
2009-10-28 00:52:49,"Little Orleans, MD",Mark,,"I got a $40,000 loan from Sallie Mae in 2005. At the time, I was anticipating to have a culinary career and be able to pay upon graduating. During the final semester, I did make some interest payment on the loan to help keep it low. After graduating, I was able to get my career started and made payments on time. Then, unfortunate circumstances happened. I lost my job and so I used the forbearance option.As the years went by, I struggled in finding another career and doing my best to make payments. Today, I work a job I was lucky to get with this economy, have exhausted my forbearance usage, and have not been able to make payments since I make less than $20,000 yearly. However, they keep harassing me by calling my home or work wanting to collect my payment which are still not affordable. Thanks to cost of living.I am planning to file bankruptcy even though Sallie Mae can't be discharged. But even then, I still won't be able to afford their payments, again, due to job market/cost of living. One rep from them even said, ""Can't you skip rent one month?"" or ""Borrow from a friend to make your loan current."" Oh, yes. I am going to risk being evicted. I don't think so. I can't get an additional job, friends/family can't help pay my debts. So what can I do?"
2009-10-23 05:04:46,"Pittsburgh, PA",Christina,,"I took out about $60,000 worth of private loans from Sallie Mae. I had a six-month grace period, which they started before I graduated. How this happened is, I failed a class in my last semester, so I had to take one class to graduate. I called them, and they said I had to be at least a part-time student to put off the grace period. So I ended up paying my first loan payment when I actually received my degree. Isn't that the whole point of a grace period, so you have time to find a job? How was I supposed to find a job without a degree?I make my payments online. One month, I made my online payment, and 11 days later, I was getting calls and emails saying that I was late on the payment. I logged in to my Sallie Mae account, only to find that there was no record of this transaction and the money was not taken out of my bank account. They tried to charge me more for this, but I just paid the original amount and left it at that. I tried to get payment coupons, so I could mail my payments in. But now, for some reason, they don't want to do that. Isn't that class discrimination? Not everyone has computer access.The lowest amount they will allow me to pay is $319.40 a month. I told them that that was (at the time I graduated) what I made in a month and also my rent payment. I asked if I could get lower payments just for six months. They would not work with me at all. They also like to send emails regarding something serious that I would like to call them about, but the emails are sent on Saturday mornings. Their offices are closed all weekend, so I have to wait until Monday to take care of it, ruining my entire weekend with worry."
2009-10-22 23:15:44,"Stansbury Park, UT",David,,"I have been unemployed for going on two years now. This includes a time of major surgery and recovery. I have used all my savings, retirement, etc. and am absolutely broke. I have notified Sallie Mae of this condition numerous times. I have filled out their forbearance letters, etc. I have student loans with them in an amount of approximately $40,000. They continue to call. As of this morning, it has been 8 times this week and three times today alone. I cannot get them to quit. I do not mind having a weekly call, but this constant harassment has to stop. I cannot pay. I do not have the money. So freaking sue me. They will find the same. There are no wages to garnish, no savings to swipe, no retirement to take. This harassment has to end!"
2009-10-19 00:22:30,"West Babylon, NY",Lisa,,"Apparently, this Jacylyn ** that they keep harassing me about is not paying her loan and must have given them a wrong number such as mine. They call me all the time even 8:00 am on Saturdays and 8:00 pm on Sunday. They won't stop. The people they have working there are incompetent and I don't know what to do to stop these harassing calls for someone else."
2009-10-13 16:44:23,"Lacenter, WA",Morgan,,"We settled the loan in full on 4-30-09 and have a letter stating this. We have been turned back into collections on the account. With repeated attempts to contact, we get hung up on, transferred to offices that cant help, and nobody can help us. We have faxed proof, and they admit it is scanned into the system, but it is not being removed or fixed."
2009-10-09 17:27:13,"Huntington Beach, CA",Jason,,"I have been harassed by Sallie Mae for years. Many of my friends who graduated with me have also been harassed. We want to pay, but they will not work with us. We want options!The facts I have now learned are: federal loans will work with you, including income based repayments, deferments, and forbearances, but private student loans simply do not have to. Yet they are afforded the same protections that federal loans have. The banks keep the juice running and use the government and Sallie Mae as the muscle. You cannot file bankruptcy and have these discharged. Undue hardship is proven in less than 1% of cases. A landmark case involved an elderly borrower scraping by on Social Security and was fully disabled yet still did not qualify. They simply do not need to work with you! The law is on their side. If you do not comply, they will use every tactic available walking the fine letter of the law, including scare tactics to make you pay. And in the end, if you do not pay, there is no statute of limitations on student loans and they will ruin your credit up to 7 years after the last dime they are owed. And I guarantee in under a year of non-payment/default status, they will garnish your wages (I believe it is about 160 days). The percentage varies state to state on the amount they can take between 10% and 25% of your after tax pay (so-called disposable income).If you are already in this situation, here are a few things I did.Keep working with Sallie Mae the best you can. Hold them at bay, go back to school (half-time) at community college, and stall. Whatever you have to do to, stay out of default as default is hard to get out of and has even less options are available. Write you state senators. Write you local state representatives. Write the Secretary of Education in Washington, D.C. Contact the **: they, in some cases, will act as intermediaries on your behalf. Join these two groups to get more info: Facebook (yes, get a Facebook account like I did just for this reason and they will keep you updated on consumer options, etc.) and the group Cancel Student Debt to Stimulate the Economy (they are 250,000 other people in the same boat as you and me!) and join the website ** for more info. And last, but definitely not the least, sign this petition so we can stop this from happening to more students. 52,000 have already signed we are 3,000 away from sending it to Pres. Obama: **.I was misled by my student loans and my loan advisors. I was a young and naive student. I had zero knowledge of lending practices! I did not understand the difference between private loans and federal! They called them alternative loans and said dont worry, they are still through Sallie Mae. Yet everyday those that spend thousands on credit cars at the mall can simply file bankruptcy or work out affordable payment plans. I went to get a higher education and only walked away with a huge debt that I will pay for the rest of my life! Everyone needs to work together to fix this. Sallie Mae is out of control. Sallie Mae is acting under legislation that was only recently passed back in 2005. It needs to be repealed so that we can have our consumer rights back."
2009-10-07 19:48:04,"Centreville, VA",Judy,,"My son took out a loan with Sallie Mae that my husband co-signed. They require him to start making interest payments while still in school but provided no information on what this amount would be upfront. Today, we got the paperwork stating that he is expected to make payments in Nov/Dec 2009 in the amount of $120, and then Jan/Feb/March 2010 payments will be $224; April/May/June 2010 payments are $336, July 2010 for the next 33 months $448, and so on and on. Hello? He's a college student. Where do they think he'll get this money from and how could they not disclose this upfront? My favorite paragraph of the letter is at the end, ""If you pay off the loan early, you will not pay a penalty. If you prepay your loan, you will not be entitled to a refund of any finance charge."" So we have to pay all the finance charges even if we pay the loan off early? How is that legal? Mortgage companies cannot do this, banks cannot do this."
2009-10-07 00:28:46,"Longwood, FL",Dee,,"Sallie Mae has slowed down the processing of payments recently. We, as borrowers, are expected to make payments on time, but payments are not processed in a timely manner. There is no reason in this day and age that a payment that formerly took two days to post (remember they electronically process our checks) now is taking in excess of 10 days. This has happened not once, but twice. And then begins the process of hate mail from Sallie Mae threatening all sorts of recourse that they have. What is our recourse? Only this forum. Why not set up for Auto Debit? Well, in the past year, I've discontinued all auto payments after one company debited my account twice instead of once, causing numerous problems with my account that took months to clear up and while making another payment to a credit card company, my information was sent to a server in the Ukraine due to a lapse in security according to the notification I received from the processing company. I'm back to checks, but my mortgage holder and Sallie Mae take 10 or more days to process payments. It's insidious and unfair and we are powerless to stop it; the consumer just can't catch a break!"
2009-10-03 14:47:44,"Stoughton, MA",Prisnel,,"A recent graduate from my graduate school program, I owe Sallie Mae $62,000 in total and since my grace period had expired, I was hoping to work with them to begin making minimal payments and keep my credit score in good standing. Upon contacting Sallie Mae and trying to get them to work with me, I was told that I'd completely exceeded all of my hardship, deferment, grace periods, and any other time allotted to defer payment and needed to start making payments of $1,700/month immediately before my information goes to collections. I informed the analyst that this amount is equivalent to my total bills and is ludicrous. I wanted to work with them to lower my payments and write some of the payment amount into the principal to hopefully make payments manageable, but was consistently told that my only option is the pay the total amount allotted. This was after 4-5 calls in to them and speaking to different people and getting transferred all over their company.Then, I caught wind of the IBR program and during an informative webinar became aware of something called the Ombudsman's office (it's a crime that this information isn't more publicized to consumers). I received a call from Sallie Mae a few days later seeking an update on my situation and informed them that I have no recourse and have tried to work with them but am getting nowhere, that I'll be reaching out to the local Ombudsman's office to get them involved in hopefully helping me deal with Sallie Mae. At that point, it was like a switch was flipped or I used a magic word. The analyst's demeanor changed and she wanted to work with me now. She mentioned to me that I absolutely still had 2 years of forbearance available on my gov't. loans and that my private loans could be restructured down to a $70/month payment which I can afford. This was welcome news but it also greatly confused me. This didn't seem like proper business practice and I was quite furious that I had to go through so much stress and then I mention one word and everything went as it should've otherwise. Here's the most frustrating thing. Three weeks later, my little sister who's completing her undergrad at U of Phoenix calls me stating that Sallie Mae called her stating that she's in default and that she has to start paying or she will not be able to complete school. I explained to her what happened to me above and told her to mention the Ombudsman and call me back to let me know what happened. It turns out that she was hung up on three times and finally at the end got someone, mentioned the Ombudsman's office and they started working with her. She actually wasn't in default (that was false) and had consolidated her loans. They put her loans in deferment when she started school so there was a non-issue here. She's having them send her a letter to prove all of this to hand to the school. I'm having her process a complaint with the BBB, consumer affairs and the local attorney general as well in hopes that everyone can investigate what's going on with Sallie Mae and these horrible practices.This is quite concerning and I would hope that these agencies can hold businesses accountable and ensure that they are operating in good faith.Note that I was not able to obtain the specific records of conversations as they will not share this with me therefore cannot provide specific days or names of analysts who I worked with."

We already took two other loans that were consolidated and I am now paying off. Now, Sallie Mae is coming after us for payment saying that we co-signed this loan. We have tried for a month to get info on this account and see paperwork on this matter to no avail; have spoken to my daughter about this bill. Yes, she has come on hard times; a payment might be slow. I am not negating that this has to be paid, but Sallie Mae has sent me nothing as of yet.

My daughter has made two payments already and has now filed for a deferment, and the calls still won't stop. I am being harassed by these people everyday 24/7! They are not even calling my daughter who owes the loans at all. I need help in stopping this! They had the nerve to find one of my closest girlfriends and actually call her looking for me.I called them and spoke to a manager and raised hell! How dare they call others now! This is affecting my work since I work from home, my peace of mind and well-being. I am afraid and embarrassed to answer my own phone. I never answer when I have company. My daughter is upset, and I have another daughter's loans coming up in 2 months and am afraid of what may happen then! I cannot sleep at night or the weekends, because they will not stop calling!

2009-09-16 20:18:27,"Bondurant, IA",Tanya,,"Sallie Mae has been harassing me for over a year. Last August through December, I was in school and they continued to call me 20 times a day saying I owed money. Every time I would tell them I was a full-time student and they would check the clearing house to see that I was telling the truth. They would always tell me that they fixed it in the system, but the calls never stopped. Finally in December, I graduated and put all the loans into forbearance, this stopped the calls for about a week and then they started calling again saying I owed and was behind. Again, I would explain to them I had just paid to put them in forbearance. They would then tell me that I hadn't and I would have to fight with them. This has continued over and over since then. I pay to put them in forbearance because I'm not working and then they continue to call me 15-20 times a day saying I owe them. I'm so sick of it!"
2009-09-16 16:42:22,"Beverly, MA",Amy,,"After speaking to Nancy and explaining that the calls are harassment, she said it isn't and they are allowed to call up to 8 times a day! 8 times! This is harassment! I explained I do not use my phone as I'm hearing impaired and do not own a TTY (they are expensive)! She didn't even have a record on file that my mom spoke to them (who is my authorized person on the account) today or about the program that I had to select for the payments. And there is not a $50 forbearance fee as they say on the site! So not only do they misinform, they dont have the correct information in their system. I think loan companies need to do forgiveness programs or get rid of the loan program all together."
2009-09-15 15:43:43,"Springlake, TX",Camille,,"I am a co-signer of a student loan. Until March, 2009, we have received paper bills each month so we can make monthly payments. The bills no longer come and the loan is in default. When I called to ask, they said they will no longer send paper bills, because the borrower called and requested bills be sent by email. The borrower does not have an email account and Sallie Mae will not send me a bill so I can pay it. Why will they not let me pay the bill? That is all I want to do. No wonder the government had to bail them out. They refuse to take money from those who want to pay but because I am the co-signer of the loan, my credit has been destroyed because of loan default on a loan that the lender will not let me pay on. What is wrong with this picture? How do I get a paper bill so there would be no more loan default?"
2009-09-15 04:38:00,"Dallas, TX",Christopher,,"After years of phone calls and harassment directed at myself and family members (including non-family members), I called Sallie Mae several times to fix the problem. Currently out of a job and unable to pay the bills, they asked for a small amount (which I had to scrape together) to hold the account from going into collections for 30 days. I paid it, but I began receiving calls again within a week or so. After calling them again, I explained the situation and was told paperwork would be sent regarding unemployment forbearance. I never got the paperwork, but I did receive notices that my accounts had been sold to a collection agency. There was no contact from Sallie Mae to inform me of this. Now, I have to deal with collection agencies when I should have been able to defer my payments until I got a job! My brother is co-signer on one of the loans and I know this will affect his credit as well as my own, despite efforts to find solutions to the problem. It should be illegal for them to operate in this manner."
2009-09-12 18:55:35,"Boise, ID",Dorothy,,"I am a cosigner for my grandson on a Sallie Mae student loan. I have been receiving an annual student loan interest statement to cosigners. It took my old lady brain far too long to realize Sallie Mae has been charging almost 10% interest on my grandsons loan. That's because this interest statement to cosigners did not say a thing about the amount of interest charged. How strange is that? There's an interest capitalization amount, not sure what that means, but must be another word for compound interest. The bankers greed machine. It was my understanding this loan had an interest rate of just over 3%. I want to know why it went to almost 10% and when. I take it the rate went up because my grandson has bad credit. Why did they not consider my credit score, as cosigner, which is in the high 800s? My problem is changing interest rates without notification. Is that even legal? My complaints are nothing compared to others I have read. Its outrageous and immoral. What America needs is a non-profit for student loans. How can we have a strong America when its impossible for low income people to go to college? I wrote Anne ** at Sallie Mae. I hope to hear from her. I am a 68 year old woman with very little income. My grandson managed to get through one year, but did not have the money to go on. He got laid off from his job and could not make payments. I was paying the interest in hopes things would get better for him. If I would have known we were paying almost 10% and not the 3.2% they say they charge, I would have paid off the loan sooner. I had to use money I was living off of to pay the loan in full, $4,000.00. I ended up paying over $500.00 in interest."
2009-09-09 20:37:29,"Webster, MN",James,,"I have found my self in a position where my Excel student loan has been modified by Sallie Mae, Inc., which changed its term length from a 15-year (180-payment) term to a 20-year (240-payment) term at their own discretion and without notification, expressly against my consent, and outside of the terms on my Excel loan agreement.This action, beginning in 2001, has now in 2009 resulted in the knowingly fraudulent and mis-represented collection activities reported to existing credit bureaus such as TransUnion, Experian, and Equifax. The illegal action of Sallie Mae in adjusting the terms of my established Excel loan has been openly admitted and documented by Sallie Mae, stating this was at their discretion. This unrequested action has in effect added 33% to the term length of the loan and thousands of dollars of interest payments required, all at Sallie Mae's benefit with no benefit or justification to the loan holder.Sallie Mae is now demanding satisfaction for this 33% increase and the resulting interest payments. I have a complete time line and copies of all documentation currently in my possession from original loan documentation and promissory notes to my conversations with them in 2001/2002 to the current disputed correspondence, payment schedules, and credit reports. Additionally, MN state Attorney General's office have requested a review of the situation. Sallie Mae has been unresponsive to their request as well. It appears Sallie Mae believes it is immune to the law."
2009-09-09 02:15:58,"Spartanburg, sc",R.,,"My issue is that I am a co-signer for a Sallie Mae school loan for my son at Epic Aviation in New Smyrna Beach, FL. For some reason(s), he left the school in Feb. 09. He requested the balance of the loan be refunded to him or returned to Sallie Mae. We have gotten three responses from the School acknowledging that the refund is due, but we can't seem to get it. Since he is not presently in school, the full payments are now due. Question, how do we encourage the school to refund the balance due?"
2009-09-04 22:02:24,"Deer Park, TX",Tammy,,"I'm trying to get all loan groups on auto-payment. One group is on auto pay. When applying to get others on auto-pay, Sallie Mae cancelled original auto-pay. I didn't know at first it was cancelled, didn't make the manual payment. In order to get back in good standing, you are forced to agree to forbearance thereby getting whacked with capitalized interest. I have tried for several months to get all groups on auto-pay which still has not happened. I was told by Mr. **, a supervisor, that the second group was not yet in auto-pay (09/04/09), though I have an email notice from them dated 09/02/09 stating that it was. During call last month, the agent assured me that all loan groups would be auto paid on 09/01/09. Mr. ** stated that he could not be accountable for what the other agent told me."
2009-08-31 15:12:09,"Orland Park, IL",Elise,,"Three days ago, I received a bill for outstanding interest due on a student loan taken out for my daughter. Since all interest is capitalized, I paid it immediately and noticed that the date on it was June 16, 2009. I received it August 28, 2009. In checking the envelope, there is no postmark. How can Sallie Mae send out documents that allude to an interest payment that is time sensitive when they erroneously date it 3 months prior to it being sent? This means that Sallie Mae can charge for interest past the capitalization date to justify their action and the borrower potentially will never be able to avoid capitalization even though payments were made. Please check into this. Thank you."
2009-08-29 14:45:50,"Seward, PA",Linda,,"My son is behind in his school loans but is trying to catch up. When he calls Sallie Mae, they tell him he has to pay what he owes. But the real problem is they keep calling me and my parents. When asked how they got my parents' number, they said when my son filled applications to apply for UPJ, he listed them as an emergency contact number. That was over 15 years ago. My son asked them to please stop calling his grandparents as they are elderly. My Dad is 91, and they could fall or run into something trying to get to the phone on time. And the calls upset them. Sallie Mae calls at all times, sometimes before 8 am and after 9 pm. My parents are old and getting calls at these times alarm them, and they are worried that something has happened to family members. My son lives on his own now, and there is no reason for Sallie Mae to contact me or my parents. We have nothing to do with these loans. I am afraid that something is going to happen to my parents as a result of these calls - a fall or even a heart attack (My Dad has heart problems and these calls cause him to become very agitated.). Is there anything I can do to stop these calls?"
2009-08-26 20:15:49,"Norwalk, CT",Michelle,,"I have been paying my Sallie Mae loans on time for nearly a year. I owe them approximately $100K - a mix between federal (one) and private (two) loans. While I had great difficulty paying these loans for the first months after graduation, I have been doing very well and paying them on time, which is not an easy feat, considering I have nearly $120K in loans when you factor in my final student loan I have from another lender. I need to lower my monthly payments, in order to stay afloat and to pay my loans off but I am having the worst time of it. I've visited their site time and time again, and sometimes I can find repayment options, and other times I can't. I am extremely computer literate so it's not that I can't find them because of my mistake, but its because they make it hard to find.Last night, I called their customer service number and spoke to a person who identified himself as ""Stanley."" I asked him about my options regarding my federal loan. His initial response was that I could lower my payment for two years and pay interest only. When I asked him what other options I had, he repeated that I could lower my payments for two years. I insisted that there had to be other options and he kept repeating the interest only option. After a few minutes of going back and forth, he finally said that I could look into IBR but he continued and said that it wouldn't be a good choice for me because I would end up paying more. It was shocking how difficult this information was to get from this ""Stanley"" person. If I hadn't been persistent, I would have never learned about my options. Moreover, it's not his job to discourage me from pursuing any option, whether or not it benefits Sallie Mae.I feel lost at this point. I need help making important financial decisions and I need this help rather quickly. I've decided to apply for the interest option he described only because I don't know what else I can do. I need to spend less money so I can afford to pay rent. I feel that I have been taken for a ride by this company again, and I fear that the choice I am making may not be the best in the long run. But I have to take it since it appears to be the only one."
2009-08-26 03:56:52,"South Portland, ME",Erin,,"Where do I begin? First of all, I have been accused of late payments/delinquencies even when I make payments on time. I have been thrown around the Sallie Mae ring of representatives, telling me I owe different amounts of money. I made a check out to them for $468 and they recorded it as only $46, therefore adding on a lot of late fees due to their own clerical error. I was promised the late fees would be eliminated and they never were. I was never notified that a fourth loan would go into effect. Nothing in the mail. On top of that, I have a recorded log of all the times this company called for the past month. They now call me on average of 13 times a day. I have demanded more than once that they not only stop calling me these many times, but that they stop calling my references. They still continue to call them."
2009-08-21 17:07:47,"Waukesha, WI",Brandon,,"I recently tried to purchase a new vehicle. When my credit score was hard inquired, I was found to be delinquent 17 times at 90 days late from Sallie Mae. I have never made a late payment in my history with them. Better yet, there were 0, 30-day and 0, 60-day late marks on the account. I later came to find out that my credit score was sub-par due to the report. I was unable to buy the car. I have made several attempts to argue this mark with SM, and I can't get anywhere. Whenever I call, I'm transferred from department to department. I ended up at the initial department I was originally called. I have sent letters to SM in Virginia and Pennsylvania and have not received any return letters. I tried to contact the credit bureaus to have this removed. None of them will remove the 17 marks, unless they receive a certified letter from the lender. I am only 24 years old, and now, I am required to wait 7 years until this comes off the credit report? I think not. I would like to purchase a new house in the near future. But if I can't even purchase a new car, how will I be given the credit to purchase a house?"
2009-08-20 18:58:50,"Blairsville, PA",Jacob,,"When I looked for loans for school, I called Sallie Mae and requested a loan that I can get on my own and not have to repay it until after I graduate. With that said, the Indian dude told me that a smart option loan sounded like the one for me. So, I got it and have had no problems until today when they informed me that I have a $300 payment due. The only problem with that is I'm still in school. I called them and they said, ""You have to pay the interest while you're in school."" So, the Indian dude straight up lied to me and I signed for it. I get $779 for rent and living from this loan and they want me to pay $300; $779 minus $375 for rent minus $140 for car insurance minus $50 cell phone does not add up. And I was lied to into getting this type of loan; otherwise, I wouldn't have gotten it."
2009-08-20 16:54:43,"Mandan, ND",Crystal,,"I used Sallie Mae for my graduate medical education loans, both federal and private. I am now being harassed and threatened that my credit will be ruined because I am unable to pay the full monthly payment. I am a resident physical working on a training salary. My credit card month debit is $1500. My debt to income ratio is over 100%. I was unable to get a home loan because of Sallie Mae. I was able to defer my federal loans because I am an intern, but I am unable to do anything about the private loans. I was forced into repayment during my 3rd year of medical school and had been paying the $150 to defer for 4 months. I have done this for 36 months and have now exhausted that program. I was then on a partial payment plan through Sallie Mae paying around $166/mo. I was able to do this, barely. When I called back to renew the payment plan, they told me that they have discontinued that program and that I was required to pay the full $850/month. I have explained to numerous individuals that I was unable to physically pay this amount. They have crunched the numbers, over and over and know how much I make and how much they are requesting. I have still mailed in at least $100/month to pay something, but they have told me that this will do no good. They have to have a payment of at least $550 to make my account current or else I will be sent to collections. They tell me that there is nothing they can do. Today, I was told by a Sallie Mae representative that I ""needed to live within my means"". I became very upset with her. I proceeded to tell her the situation that I was living in. I live on a cot, in another resident's house; otherwise, I would be living and sleeping my car. All of my belongings are in storage. I am unable to find a place to live because I have 2 dogs (my children). I have lost 30 lbs from not having the money to eat. Luckily, I can eat at one of the hospitals I work, for free, when the cafeteria is open. Otherwise, I would starve. I work over 100 hours a week. I am sleep deprived, and I live 1000 miles away from my family and friends. I have no support here. I had to leave my dogs at my parent's house because I have no place to put them here. I am unable to get a second job or ""moonlight"" under my training contract. I have had to move 4 times within the last year, which is not cheap. Despite all of this, I was told that I needed to come up with $1000 soon. Otherwise, I was going to collections and then, at that point, there was nothing that Sallie Mae could do for me."
2009-08-19 05:26:44,"Modesto, CA",Carolynne,,"I sent in my monthly payment of $30 to Sallie Mae on the 3rd of August. I mailed them a check. I looked at my bank statement. Sallie Mae turned my $30 payment into $307. And, because of this action, I have charges of over $100 from by bank because of other payments I made. Is this not against the law to take a check I sent in and make it any amount they want?"
2009-08-11 21:48:51,"Euclid, oh",Laura,,"I have written several letters in regards to account #**. The only correspondence I have received are payment books and threatening letters from Sallie Mae's collection office. This account was paid in full before I left Bryant and Stratton College-Willoughby Hills, Ohio in 2006. I met with the financial counselor Roxanne **, who took the payment and verified I had paid in full, shortly thereafter I received an official documentation from Sallie Mae congratulating and thanking me for paying my loans in full. I have the original letter!Within months after submitting the final payment, I received an invoice from Sallie Mae indicating I had a balance of $448.68. I sent Sallie Mae a copy of the ""Paid In Full"" invoice and letter stating the loan was paid in full. Sallie Mae did not respond to the letter, only sent a payment book. Again, I sent the copy of the ""Paid in Full"" letter. I called and spoke to a customer service rep who indicated that a mistake had been made and to disregard the paid in full letter, that I needed to pay the balance. I continued to correspond with Sallie Mae suggesting perhaps their error was crediting the funds or balance to someone else's account. I emphasized that upon meeting with Roxanne (financial advisor) at Bryant and Stratton, the final payment commitment was met. The purpose was to leave the college without a balance because I knew I was not going to return to the school.I do not feel responsible nor obligated for any errors on behalf of Sallie Mae or Bryant and Stratton. I paid in full what was presented on documentation and presently in possession of a congratulatory and thank you letter stating my loan was paid in full presented by Sallie Mae. If there was an error, the responsible party would appear to be primarily Sallie Mae and/or Bryant and Stratton. I was extended a letter of apology from Sallie Mae admitting their mistake and an accumulation of late fees, penalties and threatening collection letters. I too extended my apologies for the misunderstanding, but included the statement that I should not be held responsible for their errors for the alleged balance.They are starting to send me letters stating that I have requested postponements and/or deferments that I did not request. I hope that you at Consumer Affairs can assist me in resolving this issue that has been going on since 2006. I do not owe any money to Sallie Mae nor am I delinquent or responsible for any other obligation. It would be greatly appreciated if you could get them to stop sending invoices and clear my account.

2009-08-11 18:04:02,"Glendale, AZ",Angela,,"I found out that my ex-husband son's student loan, for which we had co-signed, was in serious shape. He had never made a payment, and the amount owed was triple the original. I believed that responsibility for this was now legally with my ex-husband, but to protect my self as much as I could, I paid them $8K while I pursued the legal route necessary. Because it was going to take so long, I cut a deal with Sallie Mae. I paid them $19K additional, and in return, they took my name off the loan. I got it in writing. More than a year later, I'm still getting harassing calls from Sallie Mae as well as from external collections agencies they've sold the account to. I keep sending copies of the agreement, but it never appears in my file. No one cares, and they are ugly. My credit report is getting continually hit. Talking to them is a nightmare; when I am able to speak with them, many times they hang up on me. I was at last told that there is one group within Sallie Mae who is responsible for the deal that was cut and they haven't done the due diligence to correct my file. Sallie Mae won't follow up and make that happen. I have to call that department myself and start the fight again. Only problem is the phone number they gave me never has a human attached. It is an answering machine telling me that the lines are busy and I should call back in an hour. It then disconnects. They are trashing my credit, upsetting me daily; and I don't even owe them any money!"
2009-08-10 22:26:58,"Flushing, NY",Eva,,"They were sent money from my income tax for a defaulted student loan I have with them. They are claiming they didn't receive anything and they keep charging me the full amount. I have proof from IRS that they took my money but it seems they don't care. I think this is ridiculous as I want to go back to school as soon as possible, but can't because this issue isn't resolved."
2009-08-08 15:30:43,"Milford, PA",Christina,,"Sallie Mae is the worst possible loan company any student applies to. I wish I had researched more and applied for loans elsewhere. First, they have my graduation date marked as December 2008, yet when I faxed them my official transcripts stating a graduation date of May 2009, I was told that I had already been given the 6-month grace period and cannot have another one. I then asked to defer my loans, because I have no job and have plans to go on to graduate school (Hopefully, if I can get more loans!) in January. They told me that I would have to pay $150 every three months to defer them. They called my cell phone about 8-9 times a day, and after I called them to discuss payment/deferment options, they call about 5 times a day now. It's stressful enough trying to find a job in this economy and living on your own, not to mention medical bills to pay off (no insurance either!). The representative I spoke with was rather rude as well. ""So, you called to push your loans back with no money?"" Um, yes. How unfair is it that my great credit and financial history is going down the craper because they make no effort to help in these hard times? I never said I wasn't paying back; I will, but how so without a job?! Where is my bailout?"
2009-08-07 20:42:55,"Newberg, OR",Samara,,"Sallie Mae has lied to me on several occasions about deferment length of time. I will pay $150 to put my loans into deferment for 6 months and then all of a sudden, I will get a past due notice saying that they only extended my deferment for a month. I do not know what to do or how to get this resolved with them. Numerous phone calls and hours of anguish and they are no help."
2009-08-07 18:41:40,"Roanoke, VA",Laurie,,"I have asked SM to stop calling my place of work about payment. I have called them three times to work out payments. I even called this morning and they called my workplace that afternoon. I feel this may be a scare tactic. I work with professionals in a healthcare facility - physicians, therapist, etc. - who know me and are very supportive. My goal is to repay my loans. I want the calling to stop at my workplace. I am very willing to work with SM, but the harassment continues regardless of that fact. It is humiliating. My supervisor has been the person taking one of the phone calls and I have to explain my situation, which even puts more pressure on me. I am already trying."
2009-08-06 22:24:25,"Houston, TX",Paul,,"On July 24th, I received a call from Sallie Mae stating I was behind on my payments. I requested forbearance on a portion of my loans until November, paid 95 dollars instead of my monthly payment of around 420 dollars, and was told to have a nice day. Eleven days later, I received a call that my public loans were 49 days past due, my private loan was 19 days past due, for a total delinquent amount of 335 dollars and six cents. Confused, I requested a post dated charge for the day of my next paycheck, about 13 days later. The representative began to process the payment, realized he had forgotten to post date it, cancelled it, and put a post dated charge. Three hours later, when checking my account balance, I realized that the original charge was pending, causing those funds to become unavailable. After speaking to them for almost an hour and a half the following day, being bounced from representative to representative, I finally ended up with Janelle, who after investigating, found out that the original request of forbearance was fully completed but not sent down for processing. Janelle wiped the delinquent amount off my account and filed a forbearance for all of my loans (since I was now so financially far in the hole). The bigger matter at hand was that the incorrect, cancelled transaction from the day before, was sitting in my bank as a pending transaction. I desperately needed access to that money, so I spoke to my bank, and managed to get a number Sallie Mae could call and cancel the transaction. At 3:00, I began trying to get through to someone who was willing to at least take that number, phone me and pretend to call. Once I finally got someone who was interested in helping me, the offices were closed, so he could not get the information needed to cancel the pending transaction. It is yet to be resolved!"
2009-07-30 17:59:43,"Park Ridge , IL",Sharl,,I was in the process of consolidating my loans through another lender so I requested a forbearance period of 3 months while it was being consolidated. The loans were never placed under forbearance and so I called. They had mentioned that they would retroactively place the account under forbearance since it was a mistake that they made. The account was placed under forbearance but they reported the account as delinquent. They refused to remove it and it is now on my credit report. I spoke to managers and they said that they are not willing to remove it because they had reported that account before fixing their mistake.
2009-07-29 21:40:06,"Knoxville, TN",Paul,,"I spoke with my previous account rep on 07/02/09 about making a $150 payment to bring my loans current and into a forbearance. My rep explained the process that it was $50 per loan and they capped it at $150. I have 5 loans, so my payment would be $150. He told me I had until the 29th of July. I called Sallie Mae today, 07/29/09, to make a $150 payment onto my loan. The rep went through loan payment options. I told him the amount I would be able to pay. He stated he had a program for me and explained it the way my previous rep had. I stated to him I was ready to pay $150 onto my account to get it current and into a forbearance. He then began requesting more money due at a later time. I explained I was only paying the amount originally agreed upon between my self and the other rep which is also the same amount he offered me in the beginning. He then put a ""manager"" named Tim on (I believe that was his name.). He began demanding more money. I told him the calls had been monitored and the notes should be in, so I know how much I was offered and he could see it too. He began to get quiet and looked over the notes. He saw where I spoke with somebody before. He still began demanding more money from me. I told him I was only paying $150 to bring them current like I was told before. He then would not accept my payment, unless I put more money with it. He began telling me about the default, and I stated to him I knew about the default because I have worked in collections of defaulted loans. I stated to him I'm paying $150 onto my loans or I would just have to deal with it in another manner. He still would not accept my money. I told him I would be filing a complaint with the BBB. He stated that I go ahead and do it. I thanked him and got off the phone."
2009-07-27 19:06:01,"Palmyra, VA",Tarlton,,"I have the misfortune of being a co-signer on a Sallie Mae loan for my nephew. He has been unable to get a job, so his loan became delinquent. As soon as I discovered, it was delinquent, I contacted Sallie Mae, got instructions on catching it up and making payments and did so. I was assured (lied to) that as long as I caught it up my credit, which has been flawless for decades, would not be compromised. I was shocked to discover the next month that they had reported me delinquent the next month. When I checked the account, I found that my payments were not fully reflected. When I contacted Sallie Mae again, I was told they had been misallocated and would be corrected. I continued making payments, but after a couple of months, my credit still showed the account delinquent. When I checked again, I found my payments again not properly reflected. I contacted Sallie Mae again and was again told they had been improperly allocated and would be corrected. After numerous emails and phone calls, I finally discovered that Sallie Mae puts all a borrower's loans on a single account number. Of course, they don't tell you that if you are a co-signer trying to make payments. That way, when your payment arrives, they are able to allocate the payment (your money) to whatever loans are the most delinquent. Since they do this across all their student loans, it substantially improves the apparent quality of their loan portfolio. It is, of course, completely illegal to use a co-signer's payments on loans for which that co-signer has no liability or affiliation of any kind. It is quite simply, theft. They get away with it because having multiple loans on one account number virtually assures this kind of mistake. So they can misuse co-signer payments and just play dumb. I have now been making payments on time for over six months, and Sallie Mae continues to report me as delinquent. I have challenged the status with the credit bureaus directly, but Sallie Mae just confirms the delinquency, even though the loan is not delinquent. I have made countless attempts to get someone at Sallie Mae to address this to no avail. Add to this the outrageous interest rate they charge (over 11% when the prime rate is less than 1%), and the fact that they still charge you the interest even if you pay the loan off early and you have what I can only characterize as a morally deficient, parasitic organization that this country would be better off without!For that reason, I am soliciting any other Sallie Mae student loan co-signers with similar experiences to participate in a class action lawsuit against Sallie Mae, as well as a petition to the SEC to bring charges against Sallie Mae for misappropriation of funds. I welcome contact from other plaintiffs as well as any litigation attorneys that would be interested in getting involved. This company is preying on people that are just trying to get an education, or help someone they care about to get one. They need to be put out of business!Consequences: Damage to otherwise perfect credit, loss of days of my time trying to sort it out. Loss of best interest rate on my recent home refinance, and resulted in my having to pay points where I have never had to do so before. This may not be a lot by itself, but given how Sallie Mae operates, and how their loan management is setup, it is a given there are lots of other co-signers out there with similar claims. Together they amount to a lot!"

2009-07-21 01:33:13,"Red Rock, OK",Ron,,"I am the co-signer on my nephew's Career Training (Private) student loan with Sallie Mae. They refuse to send me a copy of the monthly statement so that I can pay my nephew's loan payment on time. I first discovered that Sallie Mae was posting 60- and 90-day late payments when I obtained my credit report early this year. I contacted them and told them that my nephew was in Iraq, serving our country in the Air Force, to send me a copy of the monthly statement and I would pay it on time. Prior to that, I would only receive a statement when my nephew's student loan was seriously delinquent. I wrote a letter to ask them to withdraw the negative credit reporting and they responded by saying that they were fair in reporting the payments as delinquent, regardless of whether I get a statement or not. I kept trying and in March, a young man from Sallie Mae told me that he would ensure that I received a statement in the future. I have still not received a statement from Sallie Mae. I contacted them today and they told me that it was not possible for me to receive a statement until it is severely past due. Each person agrees that this is not fair lending practice but say that is the way it is. I have tried to resolve this issue responsibly but Sallie Mae is not accountable to anybody and refuse to work with me other than collect payments and threaten to assign my loan to the federal government for litigation against me. As I read the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, this in itself is illegal. I have researched these issues and I keep coming back to the fact that Sallie Mae can do whatever they want without legal consequences. I have read many complaints about unfair treatment from Sallie Mae, how they have ruined many students' financial lives, how they illegally give money to Vo-Techs and Career Centers to push the student loans to them, and how Congress continues to debate their unfair collection practices. They have lied to me on the phone. They have hung up on me several times. They have transferred to other departments that do not handle this type of loan. They don't care because apparently there are no consequences."
2009-07-17 20:03:19,"Brownwood, TX",Hailie,,"I resorted to using Sallie Mae as a student loan in January 2007. I obtained a signature student loan with them. Two years later, I've graduated and my loans are due. I consolidated all my loans or tried. I contacted Sallie Mae to discuss what I needed to do and what information I needed to be able to consolidate. They gave me all the info I needed. I did my consolidation through the government education department, which months later, after my loan was due, declined the consolidation with the government due to my loan being a ""private loan"". I never got a private loan that I was made aware of. They led me to believe I was getting a student loan, which was what their paperwork classified it as.Needless to say, all my other loans (not with Sallie Mae, thank goodness) consolidated fine. What started as a $4600 loan is now $6900 (less than 2 years later) and growing. They have the interest at 9.75%, and it compounds daily at $1.80 day just in interest. By the end of each month, less than $20.00 is actually going towards this loan. They won't consider lowering the interest at all; they won't let me consolidate with my others. I don't understand why they would truly do this to someone fresh out of school and trying to make it. It makes it almost not worth going to school in the first place.If I were dumb enough to pay out the loan on their terms, what started as a $4600 loan would be over $13,000 in the end. Unbelievable. All I can hope for is to pay them off as quick as possible. In the meantime, I still have other loans and payments to make. These folks are crooks. I don't know how they sleep at night knowing they rake people over coals day after day."
2009-07-14 00:21:52,"Santa Ana , CA",John,,"I am a student. All of my in-school deferments were accepted from many banks, such as AES, but not Sallie Mae. Then, they sent me to collections. In January 2009, they told me to pay them $100 to get hardship deferment which I do not need. I am qualified for in-school deferment, but I still paid them $100. They just wanted to collect my money and still sent me to collections. They charge me extra and abuse my phone day, night, and weekend on non-business hours. It damaged my credit and tried to increase the money. In 2007, I filed bankruptcy even though the student loan was not discharge, but it does not mean that right after they abuse me; for what while they knew I could not pay, their intention was to damage my mental well-being and my life on purpose. Some of their representatives threatened to put me into jail. I requested, but they did not send me the promissory note as well as an explanation. My psychiatrist and attorney want to file a charge against them."
2009-07-08 20:46:34,"Los Angeles, CA",V,,"I called 6 times, waited over 5 minutes for each call, finally speaking to a live person, gave them my information, and the call disconnected. This happens each time. What a joke the call center is. I can barely understand what they are saying. The India call center reps just parrot back the information you give them. They do no help."
2009-07-03 05:10:37,"Fresno, CA",Eva,,"My son and daughter took out loans for education. I have sent payments to Sallie Mae. Sallie Mae applied the money to the wrong account more than six times. I sent the money in the different envelopes and on different days. I put the account number on the outside of the envelope and on the check in four places with a name and date of birth, but Sallie Mae still applies the money to the wrong account. Sallie Mae has sent one account to collections and she now has a bad credit rating. I have called several times and spoke to different representatives, sent letters twice, but it still does not get corrected. The loan was corrected one time, but the money was applied to late fees. But it is not me that is late, it is their incompetence that make the money posting late. What to do? Credit rating of one person has been damaged. A representative said they would send a letter to the collection agency, but that is yet to happen."
2009-06-22 11:14:28,"Newark, NY",MIke,,"This service has called my home every day for the past two weeks, even though I returned their call asking them to call me at my office. I spoke to a representative who said she would investigate the matter and call me back at my office and never did. Yesterday, 6/21/09, on a Sunday, they called and threatened me. I want to proceed under a violation of the Fair Credit Practice against them."
2009-06-16 19:22:23,"Downey, CA",Claudia,,"I received a $19,000 loan with Sallie Mae in March 2008. I have been a full-time student since then. Originally, I was attending a private college where my tuition was ridiculously expensive and I had to get a loan for it. As a student, I was told that I had to make $10 payments monthly. I had a part-time job working occasionally 10 hours every other two weeks. Luckily, I was able to make those payments and was always on time because I had it electronically taken out of my checking account. In April 2009, Sallie Mae took $236 from my checking account without verifying it with me first. I was under the impression that $10 was going to be taken out and made sure that was in the bank but definitely not $236. I called the next business day to see what had happened, and the customer service representative could not even explain to me why they took that out of my account.After being on the phone with the representative for 30 minutes, I was told that after a year of being with Sallie Mae, my monthly payments were supposed to be raised. I assured them that I was still a full-time student and could not afford to make those payments. They then told me that they needed me to send them proof that I was still in school and that they would fix it (because apparently they had no records that I was still attending school). In June 2008, I switched from my private college to an adult school continuing the same career which was court reporting. If they had no records of me still attending, then why didn't they realize this that summer when I transferred? It just didn't make any sense. I sent them copies of my statements showing that I had gone negative because of their failure to tell me that my payment was going to be increased, and they told me that they were going to fix it. But they never did.So, because I went negative and because I am only getting 10 hours weekly, there was no way for me to make the next month's payment on time. I have never been late with this company, and I just couldn't understand why they were not helping me. Honestly, if I had the money and I was told in advance that my payment was going to increase and that I would have been given the reason for it, then of course I would pay it. I borrowed the money in the first place, so I'm going to pay it back. All I wanted was for them to help, to at least give me a month advance notice that I was going to be withdrawn $236 from my checking account rather than $10. I not only had to pay insufficient fees with my bank, but I also could not afford all my other payments with credit cards and such and had late fees with them. I had to cancel my automatic payment with them so that I could catch up with my debt. And I did not pay my May payment, because I simply could not afford to do it. I had spoke to a representative again, trying to see what they were going to do for me; and they said that they were going to lower my payments to $180 monthly. Still, that was quite difficult for me, but I agreed. I never was told anything about the money that they were going to either refund back to me or use towards my next month's payment.Now, after trying to make my payments current with them. They have been calling nonstop, trying to get me to pay them and telling me an amount that will make me current. Then later, I found out when I logged in online to my account that it's another amount. This month, I made the appropriate payments later to find out that my fees were already send into collections. Still, I made more payments to get them out of collections and was given a different phone number to call to see if I can speak to a supervisor. They are very unorganized and have no idea what they are doing. The customer representatives seem as if they were never even trained and don't know anything. I supposedly spoke to a ""supervisor"" once but can almost guarantee that it was just another representative, because they treated me very poorly and did not want to help their client in any way possible."
2009-06-15 03:10:06,"Berkeley, CA",Gretchen,,"I am a 65-year-old disabled woman who is trying to re-educate myself so that I can work 1/2 time to 30 hrs. I am in my last year of school. I have paid student loans before and in June of last year had an excellent credit score. I am dependable and honest. Sallie Mae tells me that they only defer student loans for 48 months. I went from BFA to MFA. I do not have money to repay my loans.Sallie Mae says I will have to pay them $150 every 10 weeks to stay in deferment. This doesn't sound right. But since every time I call Sallie Mae, it is a different person, it is hard to know who is giving the correct information. Only three days ago, a Sallie Mae rep called and said I'm still in deferment because I am in school. I am having a very hard time since the credit crises and my credit rate has fallen because of stupid actions by the banks.Sallie Mae says not only will they destroy my credit rating by reporting me as default on my student loans, but they will barrage me with phone calls. My health is my wealth at this point, and I won't be able to handle the round the clock calls. This isn't right. If they treated me as a human being, they and I would be happier. I don't want to default on my student loans, but until I am out of school and employed (I am looking for work for next year now), I can't pay them.Is anyone watching this company? They are punishing students who might have good intentions with their badgering and not putting stuff in writing."
2009-06-11 02:28:36,"West Orange, NJ",Amika,,"This company bought an old student loan from Sallie Mae the amount of $1,081.86. I tried making payment arrangement of $100.00 per month. I was told they cannot accept anything less than $200.00 per month! I make $420.00 weekly. Among my rent and food and caring for my two children, they want to add my child support and put it towards the amount the can deduct from me. They treated wage garnishment! I know something is not right with this problem, but I don't know how to go about defending myself. I told them I just lost my car about a year ago by repossession. They did not care. I need your help in helping me to fight these people. They are charging me 25% interest. What a rip-off."
2009-06-05 18:32:39,"Houston, TX",A,,"I have a ""career loan"" through Sallie Mae for my son going to Sylvan Learning Center I have paid on this account for approximately 5 years. I always pay my payments. Sometimes they may not be on time due to dates of my payroll or other things, but they are never more than 5 -6 days late. I have also been paying more than they ask for. Well, these people will harass the heck out of you. I received a call at my work till I finally told the rude woman to stop calling me at work. She advised me that was only number she had of me. Funny, when I went home, there was message on the answering service also. I have written 2 letters to them complaining about this. They treat me like a dead beat. I have received calls on Saturday, 2 days after I have paid the bill. Their latest thing is to have a recording call you, you hit #9 as instructed, you get a message after holding for a very long time saying a representative is not available and call back during business hours Eastern Time. Well, they called me 9 at night and called me on Sunday. I have left very rude messages back to them. I have advised them I will contact the State Attorney Generals office for harassment. Why dont they go after people that are really deadbeats and not people that pay their bills. Sure I can see if I was several weeks behind, but 2-3 days is ridiculous and they always call after I have paid. I told them I would really like to default to see what that would bring. I cannot wait till the remaining balance of $4400 is paid in full with them. It is just plain harassment and is very irritating."
2009-06-04 19:29:12,"Necedah, wi",Mario,,"I have student loans with Sallie Mae, am disabled and not able to work.  I have been trying to work with Sallie Mae for close to a year now, to repay my loans.  I have applied for a forbearance and every person I talk to doesn't know a thing about it.  Sallie Mae has called my home at least six times per day, harassed whoever would answer--my mother, my girlfriend, my kids and myself.  I stopped using the home phone and they somehow get my mother's cell phone number and no, she is not a co-signer and they repeatedly call her asking about me.They called my brother's home as well, several times per day until he had to block them totally from his phone number.  Each and every time I have called them to do my part of the loan and try to resolve something, I am switched to different people until eventually they hung up on me, which has gotten so annoying I have stopped calling.Finally, I have somebody who claims they sent me an approval letter for a forbearance, and that same day, I am called by a collection agency telling me that my account was sent to them.  As of yet, I have not been able to contact Sallie Mae and get any cooperation from them--only threats of my account being past due and asking if I can make a debit payment with credit card at the time of call."
2009-06-03 21:15:29,"Greenville, NC",Jennifer,,"I have three loans from Sallie Mae, totaling $40,000; and this includes all interest to be paid. I took a year off school and was presented with a 6-month grace period then the option to get a forbearance for the price of $150 for three months, which only included 01/03/09 - 03/28/09. The next bill came, due for 03/29/09-04/28/09 for $289. That was paid on 05/0709. I then went back to school starting 05/19/09 until I graduate. The first time I spoke to someone, I was told that I had to print a form out through their website (which i could not find) and have my financial aid office fill it out and I would have to mail it in.I called them again and got a different response to my question of deferring my loans till after school because I am enrolled at least half of the time. The second time, I was told that I didn't have to do anything and that the school would take care of it for me. I then got another bill. So I called, and they told me a third version, saying I had to fill a form out and fax it in and that they would mail it to me. I never received that letter and got a phone call which said my account was past due.I then spoke to someone else (I'm in school now.), who said they would make the form available online in the next 24 hours. I printed it and faxed it on 05/20/09. (I started SS 05/19/09.) They told me that they did not receive the form until 06/02, and then I got another bill which said I owed two monthly payments since I didn't pay my previous balance and that this amount would remain on my account until paid and would accrue interest as well as more payments, because each time I enter a new term, they need my school to notify them. This brings me to the next thing. They told me I'm only in forbearance until 06/24/09, because SS1 ends then and I would have to repay after that. I went back to school starting the following day on 06/25/09 until 07/31/09. They told me that my school had until 6/28/09 (due date of bill) to notify them that I was still in school. But they already knew it wouldn't be received until 07/02/09. He stated, ""By law, you do not have to pay this loan while you are in school. However, the payment due will remain on your account until paid and we have 21 days to process your school's form"". So each time I restart a term, if they do not receive their paperwork a month in advance from the school, a payment will be charged to my account each time.The school will not send out paperwork this far in advance, because they have no knowledge if you will actually be in school in a month; things can come up--you can drop your classes, withdraw from school, anything. So basically, by the time I graduate, my first payment due will be all the payments they billed to my account each month it took them to process it. If I calculated it correctly, my first payment will be over $3,000.They also have during that 21-day period, time to call and harass the number that they have on file (which is my cell phone); and they will call you at any time during the week no matter what day. I worked for a collection agency, and by law, we were never allowed to call someone after they told us to not call anymore and remove their phone number, after 9 o'clock which is the payee's time during the week, after 6 pm which is the payee's time on Saturday, and absolutely on Sundays. If they do call you at any of those times, you have the right to sue the ** out of them. And I advise you try to get as much money out of them as possible, at least return the favor, so to speak.My mother also paid one of the payments and was charged $10 over the amount listed. When I asked the supervisor, he told me there was no fee and that the price was the normal monthly payment and no fees of any kind. I asked him then why she was charged extra, and he said because there was a processing fee for paying over the phone with her credit for $10. So why did you tell me there was no fee, yet you just said fee? Another favorite thing of mine was the idiot who told me that there were only 28 days in March. Last time I checked, the only time there's only 28 days in any month, it's every four years during a leap year, which is in February!All I wanted to do was to speak with someone who spoke fluent English and had a clear American accent, so I could understand what they were saying. I didn't sign up for this loan to get attitude from these fake telemarketers."
2009-05-31 18:43:02,"Ormond Beach, FL",Carmela,,"I need the bail out! I know government loans cannot be excused but this is ridiculous. I've been paying a parent signature loan for 5 years now even after paying 2 principal payments of $1k each. Original amount was $17,252. As of 7 months ago, only $15,008? You are instructed to put separate check and note (which they never listen or read). You call and the operators are outsourced to India? They are polite enough but don't understand your requests or care. One day back in May, I called no less than 4 times. Good thing, I am retired. Who would have time to spend such time on the phone? My son has not been able to even satisfy his other loans (3). They went from $30,000 to I'm sure now over $50K. They suggest forbearance but they do not work with you. As far as my loan, I am so upset I have written our elected officials (namely our President). It's so frustrating! On May 28, I called so many times and didn't get the correct person. (The gal on the phone felt sorry for me and whispered, ""Call this number (1-866-989-1879) instead and don't hang up until you get a supervisor."" He hung up too?! I suspect he was not who he said he was. He told me I needed operator P-66 my collector that they did make a mistake. Why didn't he correct it? Why should I call back again to ask and answer same verification questions such as name, address, phone, etc? This is a failed system. But I sense they don't care!"
2009-05-26 19:06:06,"Albany, NY",Carolyn,,"I have had student loans with Sallie Mae (not by choice, applied through the government, Sallie Mae is what I got) and I have always made payments on time. Two years ago, I lost my job. I kept up the best I could with payments, but obviously, that was hard to do. They pretended to work with me for a while with forbearance and deferments (all with huge fees), and finally when all wore all I told them I would pay what I could, but that's all I could do. I will admit that for a while I didn't make any payments, but recently I have been trying to get myself back on track. I have been paying them $100 per month (not even close to my $700 a month minimum), but I'm trying. Through all this, I've tried to get my payments lowered which, after hours on the phone, they tell me they've done this. Then, I log onto my account to pay, and nothing has changed! I have been lied to continuously by them! They do not have my phone number (thank God), but have resorted to calling family members (not co-signers) and harassing them! When I asked to speak to a manager, the same person I just spoke to came back on the phone claiming to be someone else! Now, after I've had to file bankruptcy, and am trying desperately to get myself back on track, after I've resumed some type of payment to them, I get a letter stating that if I don't pay my loans in full, they will default! I've tried hard to work with a company to make payments who is working against me!"

2009-05-21 02:38:31,"Rialto, CA",Gary,,"I owe on several school loans. I asked Sallie Mae to consolidate them in the fall of 2008. What I ended up with was 1 loan for $24,000 and change and 3 smaller loans that they could not consolidate into the one loan. I was looking for a 5-year car payment and I would be done. Now I have 4 loans with 2 payments of over $600 monthly. My wife was laid off in May of 08. This cut our household income from $120,000 to $60,000. The layoff came at a time when fuel took a 50% hike and everything else in the market went sky high. Our 401k plans have taken a dive or was cut to about 35% of value. These loans are rising faster than a normal person can pay them off. When in school, I was under the idea of a school loan at 3%. Ha! It is like 8% or more. These people are loan sharks and they have many associates working for the colleges across America. Just as soon as you mention that you cannot afford to go to school, they provide a way for you to go through Sallie Mae's profit margin.My wife went from making $40 to $13 per hour or $65,000 + bonus to $28,000. None of our payment can be reduced. The banks can get bailed out and let me tell you, with all the phone calls I get at home and at work, it is frustrating. They want 3 postdated checks or the full balance paid off. Ha, if I can't afford the payments, how can I pay the balance off? The next step is for Sallie Mae to garnish my paycheck or get a court order to my checking account. When that happens, I will have to give up the mortgage payment and live under a bridge like the rest of the homeless. I always wondered why people live in alleyways, parks, and under bridges. I am about to find out. Thank you, Sallie Mae and the schools you corrupted. And we thought Al Capone was a bad guy?"
2009-05-04 21:25:31,"Ny, ny",D.,,"Sallie Mae is messing with my life. I have been trying since Jan. 2009 to work with SM to get help with my loan, that I can not repay or to come up with help for me. In Jan. 09, I called to request a forbearance, the man on the phone said, ""Yes, you do qualify."" ""Great,"" I said and I filled out the paperwork which I downloaded. He even helped me fill it out.I called Sallie Mae to see what was going on with the forbearance. They said they never got it, maybe it was delayed, to call back, give it a week. I re-faxed, called back - ""oh, give it a week."" They never got it. I re-faxed 2 more times. Then I did not hear from Sallie Mae. Now, it is the end of March 09. On Sunday 8:30 am, a man called my house and said he was Sallie Mae Collection. I had no idea what he was talking about. He told me my loan was in collection, that for me to give him my social security number. I told him, ""No way,"" - I would not give him that info - ""but thank you for calling. I will call Sallie Mae on Monday."" I checked online and I saw the forbearance was rejected.On Sunday, 20 min. later, the same man called me back. I screamed at him not to ever bother me on a Sunday! I told him, ""I said I will call Sallie Mae and never ever call me again,"" and to take my number off his list and I hung up. I called Sallie Mae on Monday. They told me that I was rejected for the forbearance. The woman was very rude. She informed me that I need to check my mail.  I said that I never got anything in the mail. The woman was very, very rude. I told her that I could not repay and she went off on that I needed to repay my loan and read like a script on repaying and blamed me for not checking my email. I was in shock. What is wrong with Sallie Mae? I hung up.Now it is April, I called Sallie Mae for help. I need help and my loan is overdue. I had to call 6 times, a total of 3 hours and was transferred 30 times (yes, I counted). I was even transferred to NYS Higher Education and the woman said she could not do a thing for me, to call Sallie Mae. The next day, I called back Sallie Mae. Over an hour later, I was told that if I fill out an automatic debit form, that would be the only way to make my account current. The man said he would email it to me. He never did.I called Sallie Mae and got a very nasty woman who told me to just repay your loan. I tried to explain to her what the issue was. But she was so nasty. I just said, ""Where can I get the paperwork online so I can fill out the correct form?"" She told me, ""Not online."" I said, ""Would you please send it to me?"" She told me that I would get it in 24 hours. I asked her, ""How long to automatic debit?"" She told me, ""2 to 3 days, it will be processed."" The man prior to her told me the same thing. She told me that this was the only way.A few hours later, the form was in my email box. I filled out the form and faxed it in 2 times to the number. I called 2 days later and got a very nice woman who said, ""No, it was not received."" She said to resend it to another number, that the number I sent it to was a main number, that it may take a while for it to be processed. I also told her about the Sunday call and she said that I was 63 days late with my loan and she didn't know why anyone was calling me but that once I pay, no one will call me again. I told her to make a note never to ever call me again, that email was the best way (now that I know that is how SM does business). She said there was no way she could stop the calls. The same day, I re-faxed it again, right then, 2 times. She also told me 2 to 3 days and then my account would be current.Okay, on May 4, 09 I called Sallie Mae. One hour later, I was told by a man that my paper was received, but it takes 2 to 3 weeks for the auto debit to place.I was in shock, again. I hung up and called back another time, maybe the man was mistaken. No, according to the woman who said the same thing as the man and if my automatic debit doesn't take by May 23rd, then I had to pay it online and that I should have filled out the paperwork online; it would have been 2 or 3 days then. I told her the paper work was not online, that the only way I could get and process the paperwork was through email and fax. I was told to fax it in was the only way. All she kept saying was, ""I am sorry,"" - like all the other reps with the ""I am sorry"" script. How fake! Don't they know if you don't mean it, you don't say it?The lady told me to check back on May 23rd and if it was not in place, I needed to pay automatic debit online from my bank and that was what I should have done in the first place. I told her that I wanted to do that but was told no, the only way to make my account current was to do the auto debit. She said ""Sorry, please call back,"" and again, ""if it is not there, you have to pay online.""What is wrong with Sallie Mae? Do they want me to go into default? It seems so. Why can they not help me? Why is it so hard for them to get it straight? How many other Sallie Mae loans are they messing up?"
2009-05-04 01:49:13,"Pennsauken, NJ",David,,"I have been paying extra principal occasionally with my normal payments. I use an additional physical check to distinguish it from the normal monthly payment. In addition, I write in the checks memo space ""principal only"" and also provide a separate letter or note. I did this twice in 2007, 3 times in 2008 and once in 2009. Although the loan document indicates that any extra will be applied towards future payments unless a note comes along with the check."" Apparently, they have not been reading the notes I have been sending. Currently, there is about $1,173.00 that I am paying interest on that I should not be. I am obtaining copies of my original checks from my bank for proof of this intent. I need to have this account re-adjusted and re-calculated based on contract agreement &amp; how I sent the money in, which should bring me down $1,173.00 plus any interest that was miscalculated along with it. I have never been late or missed a payment since payments began so I am sure this is an easy fix. However, the contact to ""Customer Service"" only gives me canned answers etc. I asked what else do I need to do? Do they have special forms for future reference? But all they indicate is send a letter along with payment, which is not working and no news of rectifying the current problem."
2009-05-01 22:18:09,"Ballwin, MO",Laura,,"I am a concerned fiance. My boyfriend Chris ** went to Brooks Art Institute in CA back in 2004-2005 for a degree in Graphic Design. With minimal guidance and assistance from his parents, he did what any vulnerable young adult does when dreaming big and took the advice of his college counselor who recommended taking loans from Sallie Mae (because government loans ""were too complicated""). Therefore, Sallie Mae proceeded to give him a private loan for $20,000 and also took out two federal loans (total of $3,000 or so) for him.In the beginning of his 2nd year, the school told him he could no longer attend classes because he needed to pay his loan, which made no sense to him because he hadn't graduated yet? With no other option, he moved back home to St. Louis without a degree, in hopes that he could return to finish it once the loan issue was resolved. This never happened. He was slapped with $600 monthly payments. He was unable to make payments because he was making minimum wage at a dead-end job. He gave up his apartment since he could no longer afford that and his car payment. He moved back in with his parents to help cushion his financial situation, but it wasn't enough. He fell behind on payments, and then soon, the harassing phone calls and letters began.In 2007, we received a letter that California was making a class action suit against Sallie Mae and Brooks Art Institute because they had ""screwed over students with loans [to be frank]"". He sent his information about his loan and school records, but apparently, his situation did not apply. Last September, an unexpected pregnancy caused us to put his federal loans into a forbearance (only for 1 year). Yet still, we receive notices in the mail once a month saying we need to pay the full balance of the loan, which is now $39,000 with interest. What payments we have paid don't touch the loan itself but only the accrued interest.Chris's credit is awful (beyond repair)! We don't know what to do. I have even taken out a personal loan to get his credit straightened out but still it's in the dumps. We are afraid we will never be able to buy a home or a car or anything. He only had 3-4 credit worthy accounts, which are in good standing, but even that doesn't help. Several times he has been declined for jobs because of his bad credit. We are at our wits end and feel like this debt is going to eat us alive! It just doesn't seem right. How can they charge him that much every month when he never even got a degree? And how is he supposed to get a good job? He can't even go back to school now because he can't afford to. When is something going to give?"
2009-04-30 08:44:41,"Lakewood, CA",Jacqueline,,"I have been unemployed since I graduated from California School of Culinary Arts (many restaurants want you to be experienced in order for you to be considered). I paid Sallie Mae $130.00 to $145.00 every month so that I can pay my other bills as well, only to be forever harassed with letters threatening to send me to a collection agency and they have no understanding of what ""no job"" and ""no money"" means. Although some of those I talk to are nice, the company itself is very greedy and should be shut down and reconstructed by the federal and state governments. If this company was more compassionate and appreciative of my attempts to pay these loans, then I would not suggest such an appropriate action designed for those companies that cruelly rip people off.I cannot get any loans to pay off my bills. My credit card companies have notified me that my credit score is bad so that they have to restructure my credit. My credit score is in the dumps, which in turn has made me not employable by any places of employment I applied for work. Thanks to this ungrateful, greedy snob of a company. I can't sleep anymore, I constantly worry about money all the time, and I have migraines from all of this stress. I hate Sallie Mae so much that I would be happy if it is shut down and its employees could get a taste of being rejected and harassed and, most of all, I regret going back to school so that I could better myself."
2009-04-30 06:45:47,"Barstow, CA",Eric,,"In March of 2008, I requested a deferment on my loan. I was told by Sallie Mae that I needed a death certificate because my cosigner passed away in 2004. Sallie Mae sent me a paper to sign to get the deferment, which I signed and send back. At no time was I told I would have to pay $50.00 for this deferment. According to Sallie Maes terms and conditions, the $50.00 should have been put in my loan. The first of last week, I talked to a Mrs. ** at Sallie Mae office who was every rumored, and she hung on me twice. She also said she was going to do all of the legal stuff. Everything that is in this letter, we can prove. Mrs. ** said I cannot prove anything because that was on the phone. Sallie Mae loan is in default. The loan is with collections now. My credit is now bad."
2009-04-28 23:53:05,"West Jefferson, OH",Susan,,"I am a 63-year-old parent who borrowed $54,000 several years ago to help our daughters go to college. Today, the balance due is over $157,000 and increasing every day. In the beginning, the monthly payments were manageable, but due to job losses, illness, etc., I received forbearances. As a consequence, the monthly payments grew to over $1,000.00 a month that I am having trouble paying. My complaint relates to the excessive penalties, late fees, and capitalized interest due to forbearances that increased the monthly payment. I want to repay the money I borrowed, but at this rate, I will be dead before the loan is repaid. I am also wondering what will happen when the many parents my age who are in similar circumstances are physically or mentally not able to work to repay these loans.I am quickly becoming a very angry old woman who feels that once again, the giant corporation is seeking to crush her and anyone else they can - I just want an even playing field. After all, this is an unsecured debt and we are in an economic depression. I do feel that the only way to change this is through congressional action - they created this monster and need to fix it. We do need to become very vocal and persistent in demanding an equitable set of rules including a tax-free write-down of the excessive charges and high interest rates.I am conferring with my attorney to plan how I will or will not handle this loan when I retire in the next few years. One thing I am determined to do is not let them get me down - they cannot put me in jail and I refuse to talk with those idiots in the Philippines. What an insult to me that they are using my money to pay someone in a third world country to discuss my daughters' student loans! We must fight for justice in this matter and remember that Sallie Mae is not so big that they don't have to answer to us. I believe that what these companies fear the most is the average citizen who demands they be held accountable."
2009-04-26 22:57:29,"Sierra Vista, AZ",Kenneth,,"I took out a student loan with Sallie Mae, and despite making payments, my principal balance increases. I have written letters and made phone calls, but I get no adjustment to my balance."
2009-04-26 03:21:44,"Rensselaer, IN",Jaleen,,"In December 2008, I checked my credit report and found a Sallie Mae loan listed. I thought perhaps they purchased a student loan for which I co-signed, but discovered another company bought that loan. This was after I made one payment of $131.16 to SM. I contacted SM about a refund and they said there was another loan for which I owed. I requested a copy of the promissory note. When I did not receive the note in a fair amount of time, I called again. The person who answered the phone looked in the file and said, ""It says a letter was sent, but it was the wrong address and it came back."" I explained that I verified my address the first time I called. To make a long story short, it took several calls to SM before I finally received a copy of an electronically signed promissory note that did have my name, SS#, address, but wrong phone number. The SM computer calls my house 3-4 times a day including weekends. I used to answer it and explained to several representatives what the situation was. They just said, ""I'll make a note in your file."" Since I'm not accustomed to being a victim of fraud, I foolishly thought they would do something about it - like maybe instruct me on what to do. Finally, after going round and round with a different SM representative every time I called or they called, one kind lady explained that I needed to call the Fraud Department and leave a message. The SM Fraud Department never answers their phone. You have to leave a message. A woman from the Fraud Department called me that same day and explained what I needed to do and that I should send what info I had, which was basically the promissory note with my name on it and I also included a memo from SM that wanted my son's correct address. They had him living in Fort Wayne and none of us have ever lived in Fort Wayne. In the meantime, my son was also claiming fraud because he did not request this loan. He had to pester SM for weeks before he got a copy of yet another promissory note for the same amount, but with no co-signer listed. On April 2, 2009 I called the Fraud Department. I waited three weeks and called back on April 21 because I still had not received a fraud packet. The second person in the Fraud Department asked me (keep in mind they record these phone conversations), ""Will you assist in prosecuting?"" I answered, ""I can only tell you what I know for sure and that's, that I did not sign for a SM loan."" She repeated the question and I repeated my answer. Isn't it true? We can only tell what we know? Today is April 25, 2009 and I still do not have that fraud packet.I was told once the loan goes to default status my name will remain on it forever. I'm concerned that they are stalling on purpose to allow the proper time to pass and try to stick me for a $7,500 plus interest that I never received and knew absolutely nothing about. I called and left a message on Saturday, April 25, 2009 and said if I did not have a fraud packet by the end of next week I was turning the matter over to my attorney. Tonight, I Googled SM fraud problems and found an astounding amount of complaints against SM."
2009-04-25 00:15:17,"Springfield, MO",S,,"We are trying to get a mortgage. My boyfriend co-signed on a loan and needs a statement from Sallie Mae stating what the payments will be since the loan is still in deferment. We can't get a loan without this information. They refuse to give it to us or to the loan company. We cannot get a loan if the payments are being deferred; they refuse to put the loan in forbearance until the deferment is up. My boyfriend was told that he could get off the loan once 24 payments have been made. He wants to make those 24 payments in one lump sum to get off the loan; they will not do that. They say the payments have to be made monthly. Basically, any way that they can help us is being denied when all we really need is the payment information."
2009-04-24 03:39:23,"Walnut Creek, CA",Shar,,"When I first finished school before beginning employment, I was under forbearance (naturally). Then through the years, I began paying as soon as I could. Later, I bought a home and kept paying student loans and mortgage. My employment ended and I was in between jobs choosing to keep my mortgage paid over education loans. I began getting numerous calls, once at 5am (because the caller was in the East Coast and didn't care that I'm on Pacific Time). At any rate, every time they call they insist coercively for payment over the phone using a bank routing, which I simply refuse. At times, I've even just put the check in the mail and tell them so. But they ask me to pay over the phone and cancel the check. And they always drive the conversation to a point of asking on the recorded call ""So you are refusing to pay?!"" I explain, ""No, I am paying you, just not now because I don't have the fund in my account yet, or I just did through the mail."" But they always keep coercing me for a payment, which is basically asking do something illegal and fraudulent akin to writing a bad check.In July 2008, at a time I was unemployed, I tell the supervisor whom I'd asked for (because the caller couldn't understand ""I don't have the money"") that I'm unemployed, and they will be paid when I have the funds. The supervisor tells me ""Well, why don't you go get a job?"" Naturally, my fuse blew at that point. I lost it and advised him with creative activities using various body parts. What's next, sending someone over to break my knee caps? (At least if they came over to pay me a visit like a loan shark, I could respond with my fists or a baseball bat.) At that point, I realized the supervisors in Sallie Mae manage and lead a team with the goal of calling to coerce and harass people who are behind or unable to pay their payments.I am angered beyond the edge of my limit. I am enslaved by Sallie Mae with no legal recourse. To have a customer service supervisor tell me to look for a job (when I was and was actually waiting for a contract to start up) was beyond infuriating. This lender is insane. That was 9 months ago. Unfortunately, my contract ended, and I am again unemployed. Even for an educated skilled web worker like me, economic conditions don't care if I have used up my forbearance. My unemployment check goes to pay Sallie Mae, not other needs. I'll have to forfeit/foreclose my home because I can't dissolve education loans through bankruptcy. I see no options and my credit is screwed either way. The constant calls encroach on my personal life, wellness, and sanity. To keep a sense of humor through this, I have to adopt a case of adult onset Tourette's syndrome (triggered by Sallie Mae)."
2009-04-23 17:08:24,"Stafford, VA",Deborah,,"I attended school from Oct. 2003 until June 2006 where I earned my Bachelors of Fine Arts Degree. (Before I tell you my story, let me first tell you that I have paid off two student loans in the past.) To go to school, I did not have money and had to rely on student loans. Every time a quarter would come up, I had to go and sign for my loans. Some were signature loans. I was never advised that they were different from any other loan and all of them were approved by Sallie Mae. Once done with school, I got the bill in the mail for $90,000.00. First off, I was floored (I should have noticed the high amounts, but I wanted to go and finish school). I am an older woman and just divorced after 25 years. I needed more money.The billings started after 6 months, and I was floored again. I would owe each month around $2,300.00. I found out by contacting them that the signature loans were high interest loans. One was 21% and the least one was 17%. That was the majority of the money I received from them. I was able to consolidate around $20,000 for a payment of $127.00 a month through a bank other than Sallie Mae. So I owe around $70,000. I contacted Sallie Mae and told them that for one, I did not even make that much in a month. So they gave me a forbearance. This kept on going on until just recently when I ran out of forbearance time. They give you 5. I still cannot afford the payments and asked several people if they could work with me and accept what I could afford. (During the past year, my mother who lived with me and helped me with the mortgage and food committed suicide; then, I had no money left for bills or the mortgage.) My house just now went into foreclosure and I had to declare bankruptcy. I tried to talk to these people. They seem to think that money grows on trees. I went through my bills with them (car payment, rent utilities, plus my son is out of a job and I have to help him as well). I want to pay this debt, but I can only afford $100.00 a month. I tried to explain and ask how come the mortgage companies can lower the interest rates and they can't. I did not get an explanation. I was just told that is not the way they operate.I need help. Since I moved, my phone number had changed. So they found my work number (I did not give that to them). Now, I am getting harassed at work 3 to 4 times daily. Can they do that? I am a hardworking, tax-paying citizen that has fallen down on her luck, and no one seems to care. If you can help me, I'd appreciate it. I was hoping that the bankruptcy would take that debt away and then was told it does not. These people are worse than the bill collectors were, calling me all day long at work. I am very upset and need someone on my side. Like I said, I don't want to default; but at this point, I don't really have a choice. They told me that unless I make the whole payment, they will come after me. Is this America? I feel like I live in a communist country where my rights are being taken away from me. Please help me if you can."
2009-04-23 16:33:25,"Northbridge, MA",Melissa,,"I had graduated from Dean in 2002. Before I even graduated, I got my first bill from Sallie Mae. I was good for a year paying them off. Then I lost my job, and I could no longer pay them. I got a job and started paying again. Okay, so now 6 years later, I have filed bankruptcy, changed jobs, have had a family and just don't make enough to payback. Now, they have threatened me that they will take my whole paycheck every week and my taxes. Basically, I put my family out on the streets. Did you know that when you give Sallie Mae your money they just give it right back to the President? He's gotten enough of my money to bail people out; I don't think he needs more. Sallie Mae steals money and harasses you. I have gotten calls 11 times a day. Isn't there a law about harassment calls? If I quit or lose my job, they'll take the money out of my husbands two jobs. Never ever get a loan with Sallie Mae. What a mistake. Maybe I should have never gone to school. I work and don't see my paycheck. Sallie Mae now gets the whole thing."

They tell me to fax them a letter with my request and signature, and they will change it within the next month. This has not happened, and I have faxed a letter every month since then. All I can speak with is people from India (which I love) but do not speak very good English. I can pay the same amount. I just need to change my due date. I guess they are making a killing off my late fees. Is this legal?"
2009-04-23 00:06:16,"Woodbridge, VA",Antoinette,,"After speaking with so many individuals regarding student loans through Sallie Mae, I realized how this system is set up to ruin you, both emotionally and financially. I am a public school teacher to special needs students in a low-income area. I have continually requested loan forgiveness since I am a public servant, yet they continually refuse me. According to the requirements, I qualify for this loan forgiveness program, yet they will not comply with the law! I beg you to please, please bring all these individuals together for a class action lawsuit and an appeal to the government to help these responsible people who attempted to educate themselves and now can't even make ends meet. ** I may have to stop teaching, something I really love in in order to get a better paying job just to survive.

2009-04-15 23:33:33,"Yucca Valley, CA",Jodine,,"On 4-1-09, I contacted Sallie Mae to request a a letter for a mortgage lender. I needed it to say I am in forbearance and the estimate amount of my monthly payment under standard repayment. I was told I would have it in 7 days. I called back on 4-2-09 to double check if I had requested the right letter. They had no record of me calling on the first, but they would be happy to send out the letter and I would have it in 7 days. Cool! On 4-9-09, I called because I hadn't received the letter. They showed it was generated on 4-7-09. But no problem, I would receive it by email that night. On 4-10-09, I called them because I never received the email. I was told that letter could not be sent via email and their records show my letter was sent on 4-7-09 (mmm, thought it was generated on 4-7). I asked them to resubmit the request just to be safe as it is the only thing standing between me and a home loan. They said they would. On 4-13-09, I called and was told again that the letter was sent on the 7th. No request for a second letter showed in their files. I again requested a second letter be generated. On 4-14-09, I called to see if the request for a second letter was showing in their records. It wasn't. I went to their website and clicked on the contact us link and explained what was happening, and that I was very upset with their customer service. This is what I received in reply:Thank you for your inquiry and for your business with Sallie Mae. We believe in providing quality customer service and are continually updating our procedures at all facilities to ensure this commitment is met. I am very sorry that we fell short of that goal. Thank you for bringing your experience to our attention so that we may identify ways to improve our service. We at Sallie Mae look forward to providing you with the service you deserve. According to our records, the letter was sent to you via email on April 7, 2009. You should have received the letter within 24 to 48 hours. I have resent the letter to you via email. You should receive the letter in approximately 24 to 48 hours. If we may be of further assistance, please visit our website at www.salliemae.com.I thought it couldn't be sent via email! 15 days and counting. I could be in freaking escrow right now. Without this letter, I can't qualify for the USDA loan and have to go FHA, which means I need $5,000 to $8,000 vs $0 out of pocket with USDA. Thank you Sallie Mae for the wonderful service."
2009-04-15 14:30:23,"Charleston, WV",Dana,,"I obtained graduate school loans through Sallie Mae to become a school counselor. For years, I have begged Sallie Mae to let me make payments of $100.00 - $200.00 a month, as I work in a low-income area. Sallie Mae has repeatedly refused, saying that my request does not match their formula. The only option they have ever offered is forbearance, which of course makes my loan larger. What began as a $20,000.00 loan is now $53,000 (which, by the way, is more than my yearly salary)! I need help with this ongoing issue. I have tried over the years to speak with supervisors, etc., to no avail. This is very frustrating. I am placed in a position of helplessness, and moreover, it feels unethical."
2009-04-14 23:38:53,"Phila, PA",Maryellen,,"I call Sallie Mae constantly. I wrote a letter, but to no avail. When I did get through two weeks ago or so, a person with an accent from out of the country said they would send me a credit history - which they did for the years 2004-2005. I am paying such a high interest, but it says $4.75%. I am trying to pay off the whole loan and send quadruple payments. According to my calculations, I owe $800.00. They say I owed $1,494.00. But on all the bills they send you or even online accounts that I try to manage, the interest applied is always different. You have to be a super CPA to understand this. I took out $5,000 in 2004, returning for a second grad degree to be a teacher in early childhood. I went into deferment, yet made good on payments when I could. I have paid around $7,000, which is a lot of interest on a $5,000 loan. No one could tell me that I would be paid off if I did my final outstanding principal. I am going to write to my senators and congressmen as well as you because I am getting nowhere. They are harassing me, saying I am past overdue yet even though I want to pay it off, they can't seem to tell me what that is. Very confusing and frustrating. The website looks like sales, sales, sales from hell. I have very good credit, but I fear they will ruin it. I will never take loans again and after the trouble with them in the beginning. They sold me this loan like a car salesman and did not let me know what it would entail, so I stopped and began paying school with my credit cards. They are a big mess. They constantly hang up on you even when you ask a simple question. I have been hung up on twenty times or so and all I said was my name sometimes (I have never gotten the chance to get a manager or get mad at them, I wish!). I need help and so does the rest of America! Scary!"
2009-04-13 18:59:30,"Chatsworth, CA",Elisia,,"I was attending a respiratory program when I applied for a career training loan from Sallie Mae. The company and I spoke on the phone several times. I gave them all my information and told them I was attending Simi Valley adult school. They told me that my school was covered under the career training loan and to go online and find my school under the city name. I found Simi Valley Score and filled out my personal info. I signed off on the loan, which was the biggest mistake of my life! The first disbursement was never received by my school nor I. I had to cancel the rest and drop out of school due to no funds for my tuition. I only had one year left. I was so depressed for months. I am now being charged for the loan that I never had. I am now in default because I am not paying for a loan I never received. My school and I have sent many letters to Sallie Mae notifying them that we never received the check and to please do an investigation to find out where the check was sent, and to put a stop on the check. They have done nothing to help me, but ruin my life and credit. I found out where the check was sent, but they still have not helped me. Please, I am crying out for help!"
2009-04-10 14:37:43,"Atlanta, GA",Melissa,,"After graduating just before the recession in May '08, I was due for repayment of my loans - four separate ones, making my payment over $700 a month. Just to get 3 month forbearance, I had to pay $150, which does not go to my balance. 2 months later, I was told that I had to pay another one. When I called to make the second payment to extend my forbearance, I asked to speak to the person and extension I had spoken with the first time, as she said I could contact her directly. I was hung up on by the first accented person after he refused to transfer me and I asked why. The second person said they do not have the capability to transfer my call, which is absurd. Heaven forbid I am allowed to discuss my loan situation with someone who may be familiar with me. I constantly get hung up on when asking questions they do not want to answer. I get told something different every time I call. The first time I tried to get forbearance, I was told that deferments were not allowed for financial hardship. How can they expect a grad to pay $700 a month in a recession, after graduating a few months prior? How is financial hardship given the global economy not grounds for them to work with me on this? It is unbelievable. After getting two short forbearances, I am now told that I will have to make a payment of almost $800 to get 3 month forbearance, once this one ends. If I could do that, I would make a payment!Their practices are unfair and completely irrational. They ruin people's credit as soon as they get out of school, making it impossible to move forward in life and actually become financially stable. I'm going to graduate school in a few months, but if I don't make a payment once this is up in the month span between the end of my forbearance and my school enrollment, I'll have the 20 calls a day back on my phone from collections. Trying to pay for school in cash to avoid taking more loans will surely keep me from making an $800 payment. I'm terrified about the other stories of trying to consolidate, as I will do anything to consolidate my loans with another company to avoid having to deal with their unethical business practices."

The next day, I got a phone call from a very rude person saying if I don't pay, they will put me in collections and they will get their money one way or another. I told her I had an agreement with that lady, but she kept saying that they can't do agreements and I was wrong. She has been very unprofessional and ugly. I asked for a supervisor and she put me on hold for 15 minutes. She came back and said that the supervisor was busy and can't talk to me. I advised her to have him call me, but I keep having calls from her and I'm just wondering if those calls aren't recorded, and is there anything we can do as low income people.

But by the time I get done paying, it will be around 150 thousand dollars. The thing is, when I was in school, they said my loans would be around $180 a month. Cool, no problem. By the time I was out of school, I only make $10 an hour, if lucky. I called Sallie Mae to start paying. They said that I would have to pay over $700 each month. How do I do that if I have rent and other bills? I got a forbearance and had to pay $100 just to process the paperwork. Hello?! I could have used that towards some of the payment! Once the paperwork went through, I was able to pay $186 for four months. I was laid off and had to get another one. I paid my $100 like the first time but, this time, I was told I didn't have to pay anything, which was weird, and they only gave it to me for 2 months! I also met my husband in culinary school who also has student loans. Between us, we have to pay so much money a month that there is no way we could live. Once my husband was done with school, his child's mother hit him with child support (over $400 a month and that's based off $10 an hour) because she had the son when my husband went to school. How can just us, little people coming out of school, expect any of this when they are telling us it will be easy? And we're making only $10 an hour."
2009-04-04 17:01:21,"Farmington, NM",Tania,,"I have had a loan with Sallie Mae since 2000. I graduated three years ago and went into payment for a $65,000 loan. Payments were made monthly on my loan upwards of $1,834 a month. A payment was never missed. I recently started a new job and wanted to pay off the remainder of my loan. I called for a 10-day payoff and sent money in thinking I would be out from under my student loan for good. I was surprised when a month later I got a statement from Sallie Mae saying I had a balance of almost $2,000. I went back and looked over all my information and was confident this was an error on their part.I called Sallie Mae and spoke with two different people. The first person was rude, indifferent, and sounded like a robot repeating the same thing over and over. He said they had only given me the 10-day payoff on one of my two loans. The payoff on that loan would have been around $9,000, but I had sent in enough to amazingly cover both loans. After explaining this to him, he repeated the same answer. After about 30 minutes with this individual, I asked to be transferred to his supervisor. I was connected to someone who stated his name was Steven ** (I have my doubts to his real name). At any rate, I started anew with my concerns and he stated the same thing as the first individual. I proceeded to explain how this was impossible and he stated there was no record of my calling for a 10-day payoff. In the same breath, he said that they had only given me the 10-day payoff for one of my loans.After going around and around for another 40 minutes, he finally said there had been a processing error. I asked what this meant and he said they had put someone else's payment in my account six months ago. Only after I tried to do the right thing and pay off my loan did they catch this error - they charged me for the interest on the missing money. I can only imagine how much money they make off of these errors. I would not recommend getting a loan through them because despite wanting to do the right thing, they will eventually get every bit from you and then figure out how to squeeze out more. They have the upper hand in the process and you can write in to dispute the problem. But in the meantime, interest is accruing and it is a long process at that."
2009-04-02 03:14:56,"Winter Springs, FL",Brandon,,"I took out loans to attend Full Sail Real World Education in Winter Park, Florida. I took out both federal loans and private loans through Sallie Mae. I graduated and I now teach in the same area I attended school. Since graduation, I have never been able to make a single payment to Sallie Mae. My first payment range was $1,200 on a $65,000 loan. Then was reduced to $800 a month, which I still cannot pay. I only bring home around $2,000 a month and I have rent, car payment, insurance and other bills that eat up my income. Sallie Mae has been one of the worst companies I've ever dealt with and more than often when I engage in a conversation with them about my account, they yell at me and hang up. Of course they say I am not willing to pay, but I ask them ""Pay with what?"" I have to say to anyone who is thinking of dealing with Sallie Mae, please think long and hard about it. These guys have special permissions because they are their own collections agency and can quite literally call you on the phone while you're talking to them (this has happened to me)."
2009-03-31 23:45:34,"Brinkley, AR",Mike,,"Sallie mae set me up for a forbearance, Then ten calls after on the same day, saying I'm behind and need to pay. Los of fees have been added and forbearances weren't delivered. I'm on disability due to mental breakdown...this is making things much worse. Can we sue?"
2009-03-31 22:38:10,"Edison, NJ",Rachel,,"I had spoken to Sallie Mae on 2/26/09, i informed them I have been unemployed for 14 months and WANT to make payments but will like for the payments to be lowered, I was told it was a $50 fee and I will be sent paperwork. The paperwork never came. Now they sent me to collections. When you call them now the phone line constantly hangs up and is tranferred to a office in India in which S. Peters could not help me at all and transferred me to another line that hangs up. All I want is to be honest and pay what I owe and they are making this impossible. They are bullies.I am now in collections and was never notified of it."
2009-03-31 14:00:14,"Evans Mills, NY",Debra,,I have never been in a default status with Sallie Mae. I was approved for  a forebearance with them due to a financial hardship but my account was never in default. I received a letter saying that my loans were paid of by another company and that I should contact that company about repayment. Upon contacting that company I was told that they took over my loans because they were in default. I was also told that they had put me in collections. Upon further discussion about this matter I found out that I was put in a default status because I had filed a chapter 13. I was told at the time of filing a chapter 13 that school loans could not be included. I was told that I would still be reponsible for making payments on my school loans. Therefore I donot feel that Sallie Mae acted appropriately in saying that my loans were in default. Filing a chapter 13 does not put my loans in default. I was not required to start making any payments to Sallie Mae until April of 09 because of the forebearance status. I called Sallie Mae to try to discuss this matter but I  was not able to talk to anyone that I could understand. The representatives there did not speak English well enough to understand what I was trying to express and I had difficulty understanding them. It became very frustrating for me. The company who now has the loan told me to contact Sallie Mae so I feel like I am just getting the run around. I was never informed that my loan was being taken over by another company. I did not receive a certified notification regarding this matter therefore I was unaware of the lie perpertrated by Sallie Mae which stated that my loan was in default which was absolutely untrue.I was put in collections by this new company and this will effect any tax refunds that I might be entitled to in the future.
2009-03-30 21:31:22,"Charlotte, NC",C.,,"I am so fed up and stressed out with Sallie Mae. They do not care to help their customers. I have been dealing with them since December 2007. I first called them after I graduated from school because I got laid off of my two jobs and could not get unemployment so I had no income. The first thing that mad me very upset was that they had to nerve to ask me why did I get laid off of my jobs. Please tell me what the meaning of laid off from a job means. It means a job cannot pay its employees anymore and have no hours to offer to work. They made me pay $150 fee just to defer my private student loans for 6 months. Then after I deferred for 6 months, tney told me that consolidation is  no longer an option for any customers. Now, they want me to pay $400 a month in student loan payments. Granted I have a full time job unlike many others, however I do not make that much money. Sallie Mae gave me the option to be homeless and not be able to eat or pay them each month. They are rude and not understanding with the economy that we have today. I did not refuse to make a payment, however I cannot pay $400 a month on a loan paymnet, I offered to pay about $50 a month which is the most I can afford after rent, light bill, phone bill, water, gas, food, medical bills, car insurance, car maintenance,  and federal loan payments, however they refused my offer and threatening to say if I do not pay the $400 a month, that it would go to collections, then I would have to go to court, and then they would begin to draft the money out of my checking account that wouldn't even have that amount in it. After spending an hour on the phone with a rep one day, he asked me how much all of bills were a month and said he could bring my monthly bill down to $252 for 1 year however they still do not seem to understand that I cannot afford that either. The rep had me set up a payment via credit card for the month of february and said they I can pay online with my credit card if needed. Now when he took my credit card payment over the phone, he did not mention a processing fee of $14.95 for using a credit card, which was not applied, however the next month when I went to go make my payment online with my credit card, online only gives you the option to make a checking or savings account payment which I do not have either. I called in to make a credit card payment and then are told that there is  a $14.95 processing fee each time I make a credit card payment, now I can't win for losing. I have tried to meet them 1/2 way, and I still get screwed each month. I wish that I would have never taken a dime from these bastards to go to school. All they want is there money in full when they want it and do not try to work with people and they monthly incomes.Dealing with Sallie Mae has not only raised the balance of the loan amount that I already owe which is almost $40,000, however it has caused me to go into more credit card debt. I am financially, mentally, and emotionally drained from this company and it is not fair."
2009-03-25 19:35:44,"Satsuma, AL",Cathy,,"I have a student loan with sally mae and I am willing to pay my loan off after a year of being out of school I am working but not making a whole lot only if sally mae had called me I would have been willing to allow them to take what they needed to take out of my check but they are so nasty that they could not and would nopt allow me to do that that started a garnishment on my check and gave me no option at all @ 15% of my small pay which is now going to force me to go int bankruptcy and seem like nobody will get anything much. I make very little money now I am about to lose my home, my car, maybe the only job out their for me.I can;t buy grocery with what I would bring home after sally mae."
2009-03-25 14:54:15,"Tacoma, WA",Brian,,"Over the last 7 years I've paid $106,000 on a $65,000 total loan amount, but Sallie Mae has told me in writing that I still owe over $98,000. How could this be? The loan is growing faster than I can pay it off."
2009-03-25 14:24:26,"Mountain Lakes, NJ",Jessica,,"I have private student loans with Sallie Mae, and have just graduated and entered repayment, however, I have not found an actual job so I cannot make the full payments. Yesterday morning, I called and spoke with someone who gave me three options, and when I told him which one I wanted to impliment, he transferred me to the wrong department, and then I was transferred back to the ORIGINAL line, as if I had just called in, and I had to wait another 10 minutes before a customer service representative came on the phone. When I spoke with the second representative, he transferred me and disconnected the call.  That evening, I called back and spent 47 minutes on the phone with the rudest, most incompetant person I have ever spoken to in my life. He kept telling me that this would be alot easier if he didn't have to process a partial payment forbearance, as if I was trying to make his life harder-- I wish I had enough money to pay the entire loan off! He could not figure out how to answer a simple question, such as if he could take a check instead of a check card. And, I was charged $150 processing fee for the forebearance, plus $14.95 for each of the three payments I have to make. This is also the second time I've been forced to pay $150 fee. Is there anything that can be done to get the loans to another company? Or, at least may paying my loan off more reasonable? I am shocked at the level of incompentance and harassment that such a company gets away with, especially when compared to over loan companies who actually want to help you get to a solution!"
2009-03-25 02:31:06,"Charlotte, NC",Chaseenia,,"First I attended The Art Institute who promised job placement after graduation and that did not happen. I was skeptical about getting private loans but because because I just KNEW I was goingto get help with job placement, I was put at ease.  I got the loan for two years and it amounted up tp almost $40,000 for an associates degree! Now, a year later, Sallie Mae has been calling me, emailing me, sending letters, and leaving messages. I spoke to them several times and explained that I had a baby and was out of a job for a while and that I could pay them between 50-75 because I was just getting back on my feet.Several agents told me that that was not enough to pay them and that I had to pay the minimum of almost $300 per month just for my private loan! Who can afford that these days. I want to pay something but it is not what they want. Like so many others, they are affecting my credit as well. I feel at ease as to what is going to happen next. I do not want them to garnish my wages because I have to live and provide for my child. They don't seem to care about any of this. No one predicted that the economy would turn out this way. Never the less it has and there should be some line of compromise to work together."
2009-03-20 13:52:04,"Creighton, PA",Barbara,1.0,"My husband has private student loans through sallie mae, i am the cosigner.  We have tried numerous times to talk with them about our payment options.  they have told us that they have done all they can do.  We have 2 small kids, we both work full time, we have bills.  We are not trying to get out of paying it, we are tyring to work with them.  They are so rude.  I just feel there has ti be some one out there some where who can help us deal with them.  we made payments to get current and they still reported it to the credit agencies.  Resulting in a drop of 100 points in our credit rating."
2009-03-19 17:54:07,"San Francisco, CA",Aaron,,"I contacted Sallie Mae to confirm my payment amount for the month of March 2009.  I had previously been signed up to a payment plan of partial interest payments for a period of 3 months beginning in December of 2008.  I confirmed with the representative that my March 2009 payment amount was roughly $1000 and proceeded to pay that amount online on March 16th.  On March 17th I noticed that roughly $500 was removed from my account by Sallie Mae.  I immediately called, concerned because this is the same amount that was taken out of my account through the partial interest payment plan that had reached the end of it's term already.    I was informed that, no, the partial payment plan would take 4 months of automatic payments from my account (the first of which being a good faith payment) instead of the 3 months that was promised to me.  I was told there was no way to refund or cancel that payment. However, I would be able to contact my bank and put a stop payment on the $1000 that I had made and send in an adjusted payment for the difference in order to balance out my payments to equal my regular monthly amount due.  My bank could not stop payment because it was due to post that day.  I called Sallie Mae and was assured that I would be able to process a refund request for the difference once that payment was posted to my bank account.  This morning I called Sallie Mae and spent close to half an hour on the phone with their representative, who assured me on more than one occasion that the refund request had been submitted.  I had him thoroughly go over the process of a refund request and confirm once more that the request was submitted before getting off the phone.  After hanging up, I immediately called Salle Mae back to confirm that the request had been submitted.  This has become a habit with me because LITERALLY every time I speak with an agent there I am lied to and fed misinformation inevitably only to find myself in a MUCH worse predicament than what I was in before I called.  The new representative I got informed me that no refund request had been made, and that no notes of my conversation appeared on my account.  If I hadn't called back and confirmed that this request had been sent I would never have seen my money again. The previous agent basically spent half an hour on the phone doing absolutely NOTHING.    At that point I informed the representative that, while I respect them and the work they do, I can't trust one word that comes out of their mouth and requested to speak to a supervisor.  Angelina, the supervisor, walked me through the refund request process.  She asked me to fax a copy of my bank statement to their office so that they could confirm that the payments had posted to my account.  I asked her to please confirm that she had received my fax and she graciously agreed to.  She even offered to contact me by phone in order to do so.  This was an hour and a half ago.  I have sent the fax twice now.  I'm still waiting for that confirmation call.As a result of the incompetence and mismanagement I've been subjected to I am now in danger of over-drafting my bank account.  I've had to put a hold on payments for my other (equally important) bills.    To make matters worse, because of their mistake I have to wait 7-10 business days just to see if my refund request is approved by management before they will process the refund.  This is a serious inconvenience and only one of MANY nightmarish debacles I've been involved in with Sallie Mae."
2009-03-18 03:14:33,"Lake Forest, CA",Grant,,"I asked to clearify loans charged since it appeared I was being charged duplicate loan amounts for a specific date- no help at all. Further, the interest keeps my principles up and the loan amount just keeps increasing without a decrease in the principle. It appears that payments are not being credited to the principle but to whereever the Salle Loan Corp wants to apply it.economics hasn't improved- loan just keep increasing because I can't seem to justify were my payments are being applied too- the principle amount keeps increasing."
2009-03-17 18:47:49,"Gas City, IN",Tamra,,"Tried and tried to work with Sallie Mae.  My daughter who is on welfare and in dire need of assistance can get absolutely no help from this agency.  She is forced to pay 123.00 a month on a 800.00 a month income.  She has two small children and a single parent.  Now they have taken her tax check what little it is, and told her that until 123.00 is paid she will not receive her check.  She is not late on this months payment.  It is due the 19th of this month. They stated they are holding her check until this is paid.  Can they legally do this? before she is late.  We have had so many different contacts with Sallie Mae we are not sure where she stands.  Is there a lawyer out there that handles this kind of problem.  Help."
2009-03-17 14:25:47,"Marietta, GA",Jarid,,"Ever since college graduation, I have had a constant battle with Sallie Mae misapplying payments, not following through with phone conversations with customer service representatives, and harassing calls from their collections department.  Every time I speak to a representative and show proof that I have made payments according to my schedule of fees, they assure me that they will notate the account and keep this from happening.  I am still having to call every month for misapplied payments, and obligations not being met on the lender end.I have been charged late fees, accrued interested due to my account on the error of Sallie Mae."
2009-03-17 02:58:25,"Columbia, MD",linda,,"I took a loan with Sallie Mae in 1985. After much bickering with SM about interest rates and payments and job losses I paid the loan off 100% in 2006!!  SM, promised to remove the loan from my credit reports once it was paid. Now that it's paid R. Allabaugh says it will remain on my reports for another 7 years. I have written one letter of complaint after another, to SM. All my letters fall on deaf ears.  I need this 100% paid (Sallie Mae)loan off my credit reports once and for all!Sallie Mae is continues to ruin my credit and for what? I would die first before I ever returned to SM for educational loan money! Sallie Mae is worse than a loan shark!"
2009-03-12 23:20:11,"Youngstown, OH",Kelly,,"Sallie Mae has been harrassing me for months. I did not know that my loans were coming up, never got an email or anything in the mail to let me know a payment was due. After 4 months of being behind I start getting calls telling me that I need to pay now, or they will go after my co-signer and ruin our credit. I told them that there seems to be a problem that I never received anything in the mail, but they told me tough that I needed to pay up. They called my phone about 10 times a day and no one would help me out, I could not do a economic hardship or a forberance with out paying them my late payments and a $150 fee. If I could afford that I would not be in this problem. They are rude and all they do is threaten you when you call them to try to work things out. I lost my job in May of 2008 and have not been successful even with my degree of finding work. Right now I am trying to take care of my son and my self, and living with my parents to try to keep a roof over our heads."
2009-03-12 19:45:25,"Albany, NY",Veronica,,"For the 2 months I have been getting 2-5 automated calls a day, even on Sunday.  They even called my job and I never gave them that number.  I am a co-signer on my fiance's account. A couple of times I answered only to be told by a computer to hold for the next representative, I wait, and wait and wait.  After five minutes the line goes dead.  Today they called while I was home for lunch.  I was connected this time to a real person.  He told me that my account was delinquent, which it was.  Due to the Xmas season I had not been able to make the payments for the past 3 months and had +/-$400 past due.  For the past three weeks I had my online banking set up to send $75-100 payment every week.  The last week in February I had set this up after receiving a nasty call from them.  The day before the first payment was scheduled to be delivered to them I got another debt call from them.  I asked to speak with a manager and I got a man who was more nasty than the first.  I told him I had set up on my online banking for them to receive a payment each week for at least $75 until the past due amount was paid.  He said that if I didn't give him the full payment over the phone immediately through their payment system that he would mark my account refusal to pay.  To which I said: I just told you that I have already set up payments through my bank to pay you at least once a week what I can afford each week I am not refusing to pay.  He said that online banking payments will not post right away to my account and therefore my account will be marked even further past due if I didn't do the payment with him over the phone.  I told him that I could not do that cause I had already submitted the payment through my online banking and I couldn't cancel it at that point, and I said that I want it in writing that they will mark my account more delinquent just because I had used online banking. I gave him my fax number and told him that I wanted his comments in writing.  He refused and then hung up.    Today a man called me from Sallie Mae, and I told him that I have set up payments for the next two weeks to bring the account current. He said that I was very delinquent and that I had to set up payment with him immediately to stop the calls.  I said why are you calling me so many times, we only get paid once every week between the two of us and I send you a payment every week.  I can't send you anything more.  He said he was going to mark my account as refusal to pay  and I asked to speak with his boss.  His boss was worse than him!  He admitted that he sees that I have been paying every week but I needed to pay in full today to stop the calls.  I said, no you have to stop the calls because you are harassing me and under THE FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES ACT you are not allowed to harass me. I asked him for his address so that I could put it in writing.  He said  The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act applies only to third party collection companies and we are a first party collection company.  We are following the Act and only do so out of courtesy to our customers.  We can legally do anything we want to to collect a debt.  If we wanted we could call you 75 times a day we could!  -To which I was so upset I started to cry.  I said Are you threatening me? that sounded like a threat.  Can you please clarify that you said you can do anything you want to collect a debt!  He said yes. And then I hung up.Everytime I talk to their agents I am emotionally upset and have a hard time working.  When they called my job they could have gotten me fired and have given my coworkers a bad image of me because I am receiving collection calls at work."

Beginning 01/06 we began making payments of $229.33 every month and continued until now. We have paid approx $6191 to Sallie Mae over the last 2 yrs and Sallie Mae says we owe them more than we did to begin with now.  In fact, they say we now owe them $11,232.29 and still owe six more years of $229.33 in addition to that amt. Sallie Mae has been charging us a variable interest rate all this time and so we owe $3000 more now than we did at the beginning of the loan!  This has got to be illegal. If we continue to pay them at this rate for the next 6 years we will pay at least another additional $16,000 and we have already paid them $6000 - making us pay a total of $22,000 minimum for a loan that was only $8600 to begin with.

Currently I am unable to make monthly payments.  When I do have funds available, a payment is made.  They told me about the loan being given to a credit agency, and funds being taken away via income taxes.  I tried to explain to them that i am not willing to set up payments.  if the funds are not available, i will have to pay an overdraft fee.  i was then told that if i make 3 payments i would be able to have the loan placed in forberance for free.  it is starting to become a problem. i was told that (by a sallie mae rep.) the calls would not stop.

2009-03-04 01:31:59,"Philadelphia, PA",Jessica,,"I applied for financial aid when I started attending a trade school in Pennsylvania.    I started school in March of 08'.  My payments were $10 a month.  After some time went by, after finishing school, I aquired a few late fees and decided to bring my balance up to date.  I made a payent of $50 which would leave me in the clear until April of 09'.  This payment was made 2/12/09 and I recieved a bill for $10 plus a $10 late fee on 2/23/09.  I called the company and was on hold forever.  When I finally got through, to a person who couldn't speak good english, they told me that I owed this amount. After complaining to 3 representitives I asked to speak to a supervisor, who then told me this same information. Let me step back a moment to when I made this $50 payment.  I asked this representitive If my payment amount was going to change at any time, how much it was going to be , and when they it was going to change.  I was told that after six months my payents were going to be $35.80 a month.    So now back to the supervisor, he told me the amount would be $48.82, but the representitive before him said it would be $58.00 a month.  Okay so now I am very confused and need some answers.  I asked to talk to the supervisors boss and/or manager.  I was blatinly told that managers do Not take phone calls.  Also there weren't any managers around.      Keeping in mind that my mother had to co-sign for this approval.  I had her call the company and ask questions.  They told her my payments were going to be $48.82 a month.  After all this trouble, I took the initiative to call Sallie Mae in another state, New Jersey.  When I reached someone at this location she told me that all of Sallie Mae Financial Company is moving to one big office that will then be located in Deleware. I kindly asked for a corperate number because the other office wouldn't give it to me.  In this case of all the offices merging there wasn't any number for corperate at this time and wouldn't be available until the following Monday.  This woman got loud and very rude with me on the phone before hanging up on me. I am very disappointed in the company because if they are offering financial aid for students why do I and apparently a lot of others have so much trouble with them after I am finished school and trying to pay back the money loaned to me.  I am trying to do the right thing by paying this back.  I have to because I need to keep my certification.  At the same time I can't talk to an english speaking agent and I get different information everytime I call them.If I don't pay this money back they will go after my mom and ruin her credit.  I can NOT let that happen.  So basically I am stuck making payments in what ever amount they tell me even if this changes."
2009-03-04 00:18:38,"Santa Monica, CA",Laura,,"In my numerous attempts to contact Sallie Mae, I have received little response.  Actually the only direct response I ever received from the company was the following: Interest rates on private loans are non-negotiable.  For further questions, please contact our Private Loan Department at 800-695-3317 for assistance.  In these difficult financial times, I need to negotiate my extravagant, unjustly, and unfair interest rate that I have been given by this private loan company.  I am close to a %14 interest rate, forcing me to pay a monthly payment of over $900 dollars!   This figure is more than my rent. I can not afford this monthly payment, and at the end of any month, I may go into Default.  I was on forbearance but my time is now up, as of November 1st.  I need to lower my interest rate ASAP so I can pay the company ANYTHING every month.  I'm 24 years old and will be about a quarter of a MILLION dollars in debt with THIS company.  When I have taken out no more than 88,000 dollars to begin with.  This may triple by the time I can pay. Please tell me, is this justified?  All I was asking Sallie Mae was to work with me to lower by interest rate, which is an astonishing %14!  I can only afford %8, making my payments no more than $450 a month.  But still SM keeps them up to almost a grand. Taking advantage of every 18 year old that wants to go to college but who does not have financial support - is how SM does business.  I wish more than anything that I, and others, can take some kind of class-action law suit.  But I don't have anything to stand on, just my debt.    And I just needed to share this. Thank you.  LK I may go into Default any month because Sallie Mae won't lower by interest rate or monthly payments.  I may eventually go bankrupt because of this company, and have a difficult START to my working life since I am only 24."
2009-02-26 21:17:43,"Dallas, TX",Camesha,,Well I went to remington College in 2006 and I had to apply for loans to pay for tuition. well I didnt know that I was getting a private loan that I couldnt consolidate along with the others. The loan has now went into default and sallie mae will not discuss the loan with me. When I have called they transfer me out to speak with another company allied interstate. these people are rude and offer little to no assistance to their customers. Why are these loans not called private loans but rather career training loans? I feel that this is a scam and someone needs to do something about it.well now i have gotten laid off and cant afford to pay this loan. so therefor im stuck. unlike my other loans that I can placeon deferment and forbarance until im able to pay this one only causes more debt.
2009-02-24 14:28:03,"Manlius, NY",Greg,,"They cashed a check I sent them on 2/5, yet they never applied the payment to my student loan.  Called Sallie Mae and was told to contact my bank to get a copy of the front and back of the check and fax it to them.  My bank tells me it's a processed check that Sallie Mae scans into their system and my bank only has the record of the transaction and Sallie Mae has kept the check :(  P.S.- also their coupon book system is problematic in that you have to call and request a new book.  Why can't they send me a bill like everyone else ?"
2009-02-20 16:26:56,"Charlton, MA",Kimberly,,"I have student loans with Sallie Mae totaling approximately $18,000 (that's including the $4,300 in interest).  I am still in school, although not considered full-time because I am pursuing a career in nursing and the courses I am currently taking are very difficult and time consuming, and my academic advisor insisted I stick with part-time.  I am also working, but unfortunately my job has recently cut my hours to about 12 hours a week, and my search for a new job has become quite stressful.  In the mean time, Sallie Mae has decided to take it upon themselves and change my repayment status, and refuses to work with me to make the payments low enough for me to handle.  I have made endless amounts of phone calls to them with no relief.  They have told me my chances of deferment or forbearance have completely expired.  I spoke with one individual who told me I could start making interest only payments at $50 a month (which I can handle), but when I called a couple days later to make the payment I was told that I couldn't do interest only payments and had to pay the full $250.55.  I have spoken to three different people since, the first one put me on hold for 6 minutes then hung up on me, the second was so rude and sounded as if he was eating his lunch while talking to me, and the third had no idea what was going on and didn't know what to tell me.  After speaking with two different managers I have received nothing but a migraine and a drained bank account...yet I STILL receive the harassing phone calls all hours of the day and night.  Why can't this company offer an economic hardship grace period of some sort?  I'm tired of them threatening me and my parents that they're going to report us to a credit agency, but I'm out of options and their refusal to help has left me drained.  No matter how many times I try to rectify the situation, I come up dumbfounded and even more frustrated.  They have the worst customer service that I have EVER experienced, half the time the service rep hardly speaks English, the other half of the time it's people that couldn't possibly care less about you.  I think the only requisite for working there is that you have to be rude and ignorant.I recently got married, and my husband and I would like to start our life together and possibly get a house once I finish school in about two years.  I am so worried (it keeps me up at night) that the repercussions of this loan with Sallie Mae is going to haunt me for the rest of my life.  Their inability to provide for their customers is going to keep me from being able to purchase a house and start a family.  My stress level is through the roof, and I have enough to worry about between school, working, paying other bills, etc.  I should be enjoying my life right now, not worrying about Sallie Mae harassing me!  Something HAS to be done.  I just can't do this anymore."
2009-02-20 13:47:18,"Chicago, IL",Maria,,"Every time I call Sallie Mae I have been given the wrong information.  On occasion I have been threatened (as well as my father, the co-signer on the loan) for not making payments.  I have several names and ID numbers of customer service representatives that have hung up on me.  I am trying to get in touch with customer service so that i can complain.  They tell me i am not allowed to complain about reps untill i bring my account current.  I AM SO FRUSTRATED BECAUSE OF THEM!I am unable to bring my account current because of all the wrong information that i am getting from a different rep every time i call.  I dont know what is true and what is false anymore.  I really need some help."
2009-02-20 04:27:49,"North Brunswick, NJ",Joseph,,"Sallie Mae and I had an agreement to pay for my Student Loan with the option to Consolidate.  Apparently they took away that option and demand ridiculous amounts to be paid each month which would literally drive my family of 3 into ruins.  We are constantly harassed on a daily basis of greater than 8 times a day.  I was told to get a second job (already have two jobs), they told me to quit one of the jobs and get a better paying one, to ask friends and family for money and to take out another loan to pay off this loan which would eventually amount to another high debt loan.  In this day with the way the economy is, and the fact that they already ruined my credit, I have no ability to get a loan from the bank let alone put money to the side for a house, a car (in case the old one dies on me) or emergency money in case the need should ever rise.  One ludicrous discussion i had with someone from there repetitiously informed me that I owe a certain amount for nearly an hour, to which i kept informing him, I simply do not have the money for that payment only to be once again, How will you be paying for this tonight?  Please tell me why I pay taxes for for the Govt to protect me and my family when they only protect the predators that wish to make us homeless?  I love how they give money to Third World Countries and countries that have undergone war to re-establish a democratic way of life, yet they will let their own citizens who pay these taxes be eaten alive by  the likes of Sallie Mae.  Where is our protection and our Justice?  I took out the loans in order to complete college and get a better job.  I had some pitfalls in my life that prevented me to acquire the college degree I initially wanted and this left me with a hefty fine.  The school i attended did not discourage me from continuing, knowing that i had difficult times, however after reading this site I realize that Sallie Mae offered some form of compensation for the institutions in order to keep the blood money coming in.  And where was the Government to oversee this?  I'm surprised that there aren't laws keeping Government officials from receiving Bribes i mean compensations for creating laws that take away the rights of debters and completely compensate the Creditors!  Please tell me there is some form of hope and you have an answer for me.  I can't believe this site has been going on since 2005 and I have yet to see a change in the laws that protect Sallie Mae.  Does anyone actually read any of these messages?  Please respond if you do.  Thank you!We are currently in rising debt, a consolidation company has been hired to help with other debt which coincidentally was generated due to the inability to pay for the student loan from Sallie Mae.  Our Rent literally eats half my paycheck.  We do not have the money to relocate to a cheaper place and since my credit score is shot, finding another place is near impossible.  I am the only one supporting a family of 3 at the moment and things do look grim.  I have become skeptical over the abilities of those that claim that they are fighting for us and actually challenge anyone to make the difference. My sanity is on the verge of dissolution as well.  The interesting thing about my vocation is that I assist patients who find it impossible to pay for their Cancer Med.  Consider the fact that when i leave my job i'm not leaving anyone upset or worried about getting something that will prolong their quality of life for a disease that will eventually take their lives.  The not-so-kind employees at Sallie Mae proved to me that there are people out there that will push you in front of a bus in order to take the money out of your wallet.  Lets see what Barack Obama does and anyone else that claims they have our best interests at heart."
2009-02-20 02:00:22,"Belchertown, MA",Amanda,,"I graduated from high school June of 04' and planned on attending college that fall. My school recomended to all the students to use Sallie Mae to obtain loans for school. My parents didn't have a lot of money so I knew they wouldn't be able to help me out with paying for school. I also had 2 jobs my senior year of high school because I knew I would need the money. Sallie Mae told me that I was not able to get a student signature loan (their main loan i guess) because I wasn't 18. So they suggested that I apply for the parent plus loan. So i applied for the parent plus loan and had my parents cosign. Sallie Mae wouldn't approve the loan because my parents credit wasn't good enough. I contacted them again and they told me I would have to wait until I turned 18 and then reapply for the loan. I was also told that my parents could cosign on that loan and that it would be approved. I asked them how that was possible if they weren't approved on the other loan and they said that the student signature loan is based on me paying the loan back and the parent plus loan is based on my parents paying back that loan. It didn't make any sense to me, but they promised that the loan would be approved. I didn't know any better and I took their word for it. That was cutting it close though because I turned 18 on August 29th and I was suppose to start school on September 9th. So my on my birthday I reapplied for a student signature loan and had my parents cosign. Sallie Mae didn't get back to me until that Wednesday the 3rd and guess what? The loan wasn't approved. So I had to scramble to try and find someone in my family with good enough credit to cosign with less than a week before I was suppose to start classes. Thankfully my grandfather was able to. So I reapplied for the 4th time on Thursday the 4th. But it was Labor Day weekend and my loan wasn't proccessed in time because of the false information they gave me and I wasn't able to attend school until the spring.  While I was in school I paid money towards the loans even though I knew I didn't have to because I knew when I graduated the payments would be too high. I was trying to be proactive. I borrowed a total of 26k in 4 loans for 3 semesters. At the end of my 3rd semester I withdrew from school intending to reapply at community college because I was not happy with the school. My 26k loan had already turned into a 35k loan by then and I knew there would be no way I would be able to make payments when i graduated. So i never reapplied to school and was promoted at my retail job.  Now that I wasn't in school I started making monthly payments to Sallie Mae. I paid $361 a month from June 06' to July of 08'. Plus all the hundreds I paid when I didn't have too. All that time I was only paying interest so the total amount I have to pay back kept growing and is still growing today. To make matters worse I lost my job in August 08' and have only been able to find a part time job in January 09'. Now I work 2 days a week for a total of 13 hours. I had put my loans into forbearance once before because of car trouble which put me 2 months behind on all my bills, but I was able to catch back up. One of the first things I did when I lost my job was try and put my loans into forbearance again. I got an email from Sallie Mae saying I was approved and everything was all set. Then in November I get another email saying I'm 2 months behind on payments. Turns out the forbearance was only for the student signature loans (which I didn't think I had but i apparently have 2) and not for the private loans (which i have 2 of also). I asked why i didn't have a problem before with forbearance and they told me that before I had applied for a different type of forbearance. (another issue that makes no sense) So they told me they would sent me an application form for the private loans and that it would only take 3-5 days. I didnt receive the form until today, February 19th and I had requested it back in November. Not only that but I had emailed them about not receiving the form multiple times without any response from them. Finaly when I get the form, I read it through and it turns out the forbearance was only for 3 months and it was in affect from November 13 08 to February 13 09. Now they want me to pay a $238 forbearance fee even though I never got the forbearance because they kept adding to my monthly payment when it was suppose to be hold. Isn't that what forbearance is for? There is no way this can be legal. I have no idea what to do at this point. I've already lost my apartment and have moved back in with my parents, I've completely cut my expenses so now all I buy is gas and pay for the loan on my car. They are constantly calling me and my grandfather 8-12 times a day. I refuse to answer the phone when they call because the last time i talked to a real person they made it out to be all my fault for taking out a loan for school because I couldn't afford to go to school in the first place. This company needs to be held accountable. I'm suprised with all these complaints nothing has been done yet. I originally borrowed 26K and now I owe over 69k, almost triple what I borrowed. I'm 22 now and the only option it seems I have left is bankruptcy. A 22 year old should not have to file for bankruptcy!"
2009-02-20 01:31:01,"Salem, NY",Judy,,"I'm a 67 year old widow with an excellent credit rating. In 2005 I co-signed for a student loan from Sallie Mae for one of my married daughters in the amount of $1,500.00. When my daughter and her husband started having some financial difficulties I paid one payment to Sallie May and with the next bill decided to pay off the entire balance of the loan which was some 2,700 odd dollars. I don't have the exact amounts at this time due to my home burning down last October but I can access them through my bank. This final payment was in July of 2006. The following September [2006] I received another bill from them in the amount of some 90.00. I called them and explained how I had paid the balance in full and was told that it would be taken care of. I heard nothing further from them either by mail or phone for an entire year. Then out of the blue I received a phone call telling me that I owed them 180.00. I had an extremely heated exchange on the phone with some guy who was not interested in the least in hearing what I had to say but kept agressively insisting that I owed this money and had better pay it. He said that the 180.00 was for late charges and interest because the last payment made on the bill [the FULL amount owed] was late. I tried to explain to him that I had sent the money in when I had received the bill. Is it my fault if they sent it out late and evidently misplaced the entire account for a year? I could not reason with this person and so ended up hanging up the phone. About a month later I get a letter telling me that they have reconsidered and will now only charge me the original 90.00 they claim I owed. They say that this amount is the late charges and interest for the late payment of the full amount of the loan. Can someone please explain to me if this is indeed the case,and this is the only amount owed, why they are also charging my daughter a further 130.00???? I have refused to pay them anything further because I have no gaurantee that somewhere down the line they will make up some other bogus charges. Now they are threatening me with ruining my credit, hauling me into court etc., etc. unless I pay them 259.32 by March 3rd. Why has'nt somebody done something about this bunch of crooks. Surely what they are doing is nothing short of usury. These people are loan sharks and they are preying on innocent hard working Americans. This whole situation has caused me a great deal of stress.I've been under a doctor's care, in part, because of this harassment. I've been through a lot in my life including the recent loss of my home, beloved pets and everything I owned. I've always paid my debts as my credit report will show. But this situation with Sallie Mae seems to be a bottomless pit where the consumer does'nt have any say against a corporation that just makes up charges that they say you owe them and that you have no recourse against."
2009-02-19 22:02:14,"Beltsville, MD",Matt,,"Sallie Mae sent me a bill for my student loan two months after I graduated from college (February '06).  This loan was set up with the first payment date to be 6 months after graduation. My graduation date was December '05, however on the first payment bill it said that the loan officially begins on 07/07/05.  I tried to contest this at the time, but if you think they are hard to deal with now, imagine what they were like before everyone knew what they were doing to the economy. I quickly paid the payments until I could pay the loan off completely with a consolidation loan. When I started getting rejected loan applications I got a little suspicious of what was on my credit report since I have great credit and the income to back it.  Sallie Mae has a 3 months late payment charge on my credit report.  I disputed it through a credit report system and Sallie Mae refused the dispute. I called Sallie Mae in hopes that with the facts in my hand, they would remove the false charge on my credit report.  They told me that there was no one I could talk to about this and that there was no way they could remove the charge on my credit report.  So, they told me to dispute it through a credit bureau. I called the Federal Trade Commission and filed a report on the issue.  I want to encourage everyone on this page and anyone reading this with similar problems to do the same thing.  The FTC cannot dispute single claims, just take investigative and eventually legal action for repeated claims. The charge on my credit report is an obvious result of poor contractual organization and customer service.   I should not have received a bill until June '06.  I am sending Sallie Mae a formal complaint by mail and if I do not receive notice of the charge being dropped from my credit report, I will be taking the appropriate legal action. I have been unable to secure quality loans for the purpose of responsibly paying off debt.  I have a credit score in the 700s and have an income to support the loans.  Sallie Mae has solely caused this problem and seems determined to offer no assistance in fixing the problem they have caused me.  I plan to move to Europe shortly.  This country has let this absurdity go on for too long."

She set up a payment plan with Sallie Mae that they would withdraw her payment from her checking account each month. The first month it worked. The second month it didn't She waited until Sallie Mae left a message on her phone.

One time I was hung up on by the first person whom I was talking with. I never yelled but I was upset and wanted them to stop harassing my daughter and I. I was also upset that my daughter contacted Sallie Mae to put her payback on hold since she was just starting to work and money was tight because she was no longer at home and had additional expenses. Sallie Mae gladly deferred her payments but as the co-signer, they never contacted or asked me for my permission. Now they feel it is OK to harass us. The straw that broke the camel's back for me was a call my daughter received from a female Sallie Mae telemarketer who was yelling at my daughter and threatening her with financial ruination if she didn't pay her right then and there. She wanted my daughter's credit or debit card number. My daughter was upset and crying and made a bad judgment call and gave out her information to this thug. That was almost a week ago and they still have not withdrawn the funds from her account.

2009-02-18 18:48:34,"Oneonta, NY",Jen,,"I am commenting on what others have said about Sallie Mae. I have never had an issue.  Sallie Mae and other education loan institutions have been great. My boyfriend at the time was having problems paying his bill due to an increase in child support from his ex.  We called Sallie Mae.  They lowered the payment by extending the years.  Once he got caught back up he started paying more on the loaner bringing the number of years back to the minimum.  These institutions understand that everyone has financial problems from time to time.  The ONE MAIN THING TO DO: COMMUNICATE.  If you wait until you're 6 months past due, no one is going to try to help you out.  But if you call them as soon as you realize there's a problem, they'll send you the paperwork for a forbearance until things get back on track or lower your payments to help you out until you're able to catch up.  There are problem 10 different types of ways to not pay or pay less without hurting your credit or having collection calls.  You just have to call and communicate with them. For those that said I only owe $14000, why in 3 years did it jump $20000. There are INTEREST CHARGES THAT ACCUMULATE MONTHLY.  Have someone complete an amortization schedule for you so you know how much you're suppose to pay.  Go to an online calculator.  I'm sure you all have a computer since you commented on consumer affairs. It will tell you exactly how much you should pay. You put in the total amount due, interest rate and number of payments... it spits out your monthly payment. The maximum interest rate allowed to be charged is 8.9% on student loans.  If someone calls not leaving a name or number... don't give them your information.  IT'S CALLED A 'SCAM'!!!! Financial institutions will always give you a name and phone number to call to verify it legitimacy."

We have tried to help him out but we are now retired and with the increase cost of gas, utilities, and other expenses with him living with us, it is hard to keep up.We tried talking to them to have it delayed for awhile but they wanted $100 plus the payment of the loan and that will only be for 3 months. They are very annoying and will call 3 - 4 times a day even after we make a payment. In this time of economic peril is there anyway or anyone who can help my son work with this governmental agency? We are also paying his car payment and his insurance to help him through this. Do you have any advise for us on how to get them to help my son. He is becoming depressed with all the phone calls and no job in site. Thank you."
2009-02-16 15:29:41,"Hope Mills, NC","Evins,",,I am currently attending school and have been for 1 1/2 years. I borrowed money to attend this school from Salliemae education loan. It is not time for me to start paying the loan back because I am currently in school and my pay back starts in 2010 once I finish school. They call me by phone and my co-signer at least 40 times a day. I was told by Salliemae that they had contacted the school and they received a report stating that I am not enrolled and I should take this up with the school. I talked with registration and they said that all their information pertaining to their students goes to Clearinghouse. The school stated that they never talked with Salliemae. I spoke with Salliemae who continues to give me all this erroneous information. It seems to me they are trying to add charges to this account just for their gain.
2009-02-15 20:13:57,"Lincoln, IL",Mary,,"I am not able to pay my debt and they put bad debt, write off on my credit report. Can they still ask me for payment? I only make 1,171.00 a mo. on soc. sec. I worry constantly about what will happen to me."
2009-02-15 15:59:58,"Iowa City, IA",Jacqueline,,"I took out a loan with Sallie Mae for my undergraduate and Masters degrees. I'm still in school for another 2 yrs or so finishing up a Phd. Sallie Mae contacted me stating that my loan was in default. I explained that this could not be so because according to the terms of my loan I did not owe them until 6 months after I had finished school. They explained that sometimes Universities do not get their enrollment list (clearinghouse list) to them in time. They accepted that I was still in school but still insisted that I pay the past due amount on my loan. I explained that I had no intention on paying them until I had finished my degree. I checked the clearinghouse list. My enrollment has been consistently at the full time level since I began here 3 year ago. I spoke to a representative about a month ago. Today, I received a notice in the mail that I owe $170 past due on my account. I'm not sure what miscommunication they have within their business. I informed the financial aid office at the school I attend and they did nothing. I intend to contact my state attorney general and I intend to contact Senator Edward Kennedy's office. I have never been able to call Sallie Mae and talk to an agent. I've only spoken with them if they contact me. This makes it very difficult to explain my grievances to them."
2009-02-14 14:33:21,"Bradenton, FL",Bill,,I bought out a loan from them for 2100. I mailed them a money order for 700. Then I opened a bank acct and they took 2 payments of 700. Now they say I didn't buy it out and now they say it's a fed loan which it isn't. Now they took my income tax without a hearing or court for me to prove it.
2009-02-13 21:17:17,"Santa Rosa, CA",Tabatha,,"General ** threatened me in order to obtain my checking account information for payment on my student loans. This is clearly against the DNC laws and regulations regarding collections. Also, I call Sallie Mae directly to get their corporate number and they refused to give it to me so I can try and resolve my student loans. I have been trying to get a forbearance on the loans but now it is too late since it is in collection. Please help!"
2009-02-13 16:01:45,"Morgantown, IN",Sheryl,,"My husband was on permanent social security disability when he co-signed for son. Son was unable to finish college and is currently only able to find a part-time seasonal job, in another state, where he is living free with a friend. He does not own a car even. Sallie Mae is threatening to garnish my husband's social security disability check. I don't know what we would do if they garnished his check. I have been out-of-work, due to health issues first, now the economy for four years. Can they garnish his social security disability? Can they take our home?"
2009-02-12 20:34:51,"Ypsilanti, MI",Stuart,,"On 10/1/08, I made an early payment on my student loans, which are due on the 11th. Each payment is supposed to be $795.52. $433.75 was applied to my account principal. Then on 11/5/08, I made another early payment of $795.52, yet only $6.96 was applied to my principal despite the fact that approximately $680 is interest every month. On December 11, 2008, I made another timely payment and $0 was applied to my principal. I've since made a couple more payments, and nothing is being applied against my principal. According to Sallie Mae, they are compounding interest daily and making timely payments has nothing to do with principal. Essentially, this keeps someone in debt forever. Not to mention that I make payments on their website and they will not apply them for 2-4 days later, claiming it takes that long to process it, thus causing them to accrue more interest."
2009-02-12 19:57:32,"Austin, TX",Elizabeth,,So much has happened with Sallie Mae over the last 2 years I don't know where to begin. They have put a loan into default after not applying my payments to it. This is the 3rd time it has been placed into default. I paid $150 to put my loans (all of them) into forbearance and they only put 3 of them in. The best advise I can give anyone is to get a tape recorder and a lawyer. My husband and I are dealing with totally ruined credit and daily harassment from them. At one point I was receiving 12 calls a day! We have put off buying a house and starting a family because of all of this.
2009-02-11 20:17:18,"Ypsilanti, MI",Stuart,,"I have student loans with SallieMae. Originally, they were around $65k but with capitalized interest over 9 years or so, they are now approximately $125k. I started making payments in 2008 timely on the computer. However, they report the posting date 2-4 days later. Furthermore, I made an early payment in October 1, 2008 where SallieMae applied $433 to principal. My loan payments are due on the 11th of each month. I then made another early payment for the monthly amount of $795.52 on November 5, 2008 and only approximately $7 has been applied to principal. Since then, I've made many on time payments with Sallie Mae reflecting dates 2-4 days after I submitted on the computer and on top of that am having no payments go towards the principal. When I called Sallie Mae they said payments are made first to late fees, interest and principal. I understood that but if I'm making payments on time and early, then payments should reflect some payment towards the principal. I was told since I made an early payment and the capitalized interest of approximately $650 a month is on a 30-day period, that essentially, because my payment was made 36 days, from October 1 to November 6, that less was applied to principal. I asked then what you're saying is that you have essentially reset my due date without telling me and she replied no. I cannot get to a supervisor but it is obvious that SallieMae is playing games to get them more income. I don't know how anyone could ever get out of debt with their accounting practices."
2009-02-10 20:07:28,"Davis, CA",Deirdre,,"On February 4, 2009 I transferred $2000.00 via account transfer to update my son's student loan. The funds never showed on his account even though it showed on my bank statement as being transferred on February 6, 2009. My son called Sallie Mae customer service service twice and received two different answers to the issue about the funds not being posted. First they said that only $400 had been posted; on the second call they said that no payment was posted. My son gave them the confirmation number; however they stated that I would have to call and provide a FAX of my bank statement.I called Sallie Mae twice as well. The first person I spoke with said that she could not find the payment and would put in a request for research which would take two to five days. This was not acceptable so the person gave me the customer service number. Nancy found the funds transfer and all of the information in a matter of minutes; however she kept me on the line for almost 20 minutes stating that she was having the issue corrected. At the end of the conversation she said that it would take 48 hours to five days to post to my son's account. When I told her I now understood why there were so many complaints against Sallie Mae she said that I should be grateful that they were there to give my son a loan in the first place. There is no excuse for this type of business processing or behavior of staff. Sallie Mae appears to destroy credit at will, using every underhanded means to jack up the loan amount and tack on penalties. I am not the only one who is having issues. Our family has been called nonstop from 5 different area codes - all Sallie Mae. It does not surprise me that they can't keep their records in order."
2009-02-10 04:52:45,"Oxnard, CA",Sandra,,"In December 2008, I began receiving billing/statement from Sallie Mae for a student loan that was paid off in January 2006 (I do have copy of check). I have written a letter to Sallie Mae on 1/06/09 disputing that I still owe money. I also faxed that same letter to Sallie Mae on 1/06/09. In my letter to Sallie Mae, I requested a written response by 2/06/09 indicating that my balance was paid off in 1/2006 and I owed nothing. This weekend, I received yet another statement reflecting a balance of $210.43. I also received a bill via email on 2/09. I am at my wits ends with attempting to resolve this issue with Sallie Mae. My first issue is why am I receiving a bill over 2 1/2 years after the loan was paid in full? Why has not Sallie Mae responded to my letter sent on 1/06/09 and why do I continue to receive bills/statements where interest increased the amount each month? Trying to resolve this has been time consuming. In researching the Internet, I see there have been several complaints with Sallie Mae and you were a reference given that could help me resolve this issue. I would appreciate any assistance in order to get this issue resolved."
2009-02-09 06:49:14,"Lancaster, NY",Megan,,I am currently in school. I go to school online so I attend five week classes instead of semesters. My last class I attended ran between 12/16/08 and 2/2/09. The reason that class ran longer was because we had two weeks off for holiday. The class before that ran from 10/21/04 to 11/24/08 and I had another class before that.Sallie Mae has been contacting me for over two months asking for payment stating I'm not in school. My school has even sent them paperwork stating that I'm in school. They have even gotten notice from the Student Clearinghouse stating my attendance. Even if I had a couple of weeks off between classes that does not amount to the 6 months they said they give you.This is stressing me out. I am getting calls every night. They are even calling my dad who is the cosigner. When they call it's not even a real person on the line it's an message asking to call them back and when I call back I can't get through or when I do get through they hang up on me three times before I can reach someone. Not to mention the customer service department is rude. I just don't know how much more information I can give them.
2009-02-09 02:40:55,"Ridgefield, CT",Bob And Mary,,"We spoke to Sallie Mae on behalf of my son because my husband co-signed for his load. My son has been unemployed for the last 6 months without unemployment compensation. We are 4 months behind on our payments to Sallie Mae but have made partial payment along the way. We are trying to help him. We made a payment over the phone on February 5th on a credit card with the understanding that from this point on, we will be in forbearance of the front debit to be put onto the rear of the load which would be $1,100. Keep in mind this loan starting out at $9,700 and now it is up to $15,000. We were called this evening, 4 days after our credit card payment, and harassed, threatened of taking our home, salary garnished, tax returns if any garnished. They threatened us and threatened us again and again. Our new President is going from the top down instead of the bottom up.My son told the Sallie Mae employee he could not talk about this tonight on the phone because he was recovering and in the emergency room yesterday as he almost lost his life from an allergic reaction to seafood that was in a vitamin pill and they said that was no concern of theirs, they will collect from the co-signer, ""your father."" NICE PEOPLE WORKING FOR SALLIE MAE!! Please Help Us to help you by paying our bills. Thank you."
2009-02-06 22:09:25,"Sherman Oaks, CA",Tiya,,"The educational loan company, Sallie Mae, is extremely harassing. They use abusive and aggressive tactics to collect debt. I receive at a minimum one to three phone calls per hour from them with as little due as $50. The phone calls start early in the morning all the way into the night. Also before my mother passed away from cancer, she was continuously called as my reference and told that her bank accounts would be frozen. My mother was NOT a co-signer and yet she was given details about my loan. She was also sent a LETTER with my personal information. When I inquired about why my personal information was given to someone that was NOT a co-signer, I was told they made a ""mistake"". Now that she has passed, I cannot find the letter nor can I ask her for it. I just remember in her state of sickness she made someone take her to get money out of the bank so that she would have the funds to pay her medical bill. She was afraid of what they would do to what little money she had (and she was just a reference)! Their actions are inexcusable and too often too I hear similar stories from others. They put people's families and careers in jeopardy with their actions and should be held accountable."
2009-02-06 22:03:50,"La Porte, TX",Brenda,,"Sallie Mae has continued to harass my daughter and mostly me because when she applied for her student loans, I had to be a co-signer but then put me like the loan was for me. I did not get a dime of that money. My daughter is also still in school. As soon as one semester is over, they start calling wanting her to make payment. Whatever happened with 6 months after graduation then you start paying your loan back. These people are crazy. They call all time of night. When you try to talk to them they just hang up if they cannot talk over you. They give these kid loans knowing that they cannot pay them back until they get a job then they harass the parents for the money before it's due. Congress needs to do something about the company. They are rip offs."

Unfortunately I share the same first name with him. Most of the time the reps on the phone are very rude and hang up on me when I explain that there is no Robert ** at this number. I have called back multiple times requesting that I be removed from their list and spoken to managers several times. Each time I am promised that I will be removed from the list and then I continue to get calls a day or two later. Recent call I have received were on the JAN 6th, 27th, 30th, FEB 2nd, 3rd and 6th and have ask 6 times to remove my #. They are costing a fortune in cell phone minutes. Today I was hung up on twice and they refused to allow me to talk to a supervisor. The numbers I am getting calls from are 407-319-3014, 773-571-6645. I was also told to call 866-851-9593 to remove my number which I did and was hung up on 2 more times."

2009-02-05 18:59:21,"Buhl, ID",Kimberle,,"I am afraid that my story is the same as all of the others listed. We have a small farm in Idaho that my husband has owned for over 20 years. His family has farmed all of their lives. We co-signed loans for our two children through Sallie Mae. We are like all of the others. No idea what they are doing to the loan, payments that they say they don't have, rude customer service people, etc. I have just one question, why is there no legal group forming to fight the injustices of this company? I just do not understand.My son's loans are huge and continue to grow due to Sallie Mae's practices. He has Crohn's Disease which means expensive drugs and procedures. He graduated from the Art Institute of Portland. He is presently working, but how many kids can afford $600 payments when they only make about $1,500 per month? We help with the medical bills and drugs that he needs to survive, but we live in fear that we may lose our farm if problems arise. Our farm is all that we have."
2009-02-03 20:08:06,"Warren, OH",Aaron,,"I currently have a large student loan that is about to fall into default. Since my graduation, I have been unable to find any work. Everyone either tells me I am underqualified or overqualified, plus many businesses are no longer searching for new employees. I have pleaded with representatives to help me find alternatives to my loans going into default. I am no longer eligible for deferments or forbearance. And when I did defer them, I had to pay $8,000 in interest for only 3 months of deferment.With no job, no one hiring, and no help from Sallie Mae - I'm soon to be drowning in debt. Currently, I owe roughly $200,000 in student loans. Some of these loans my mother has co-signed for. She has no income and is home all day taking care of her disabled husband. They themselves aren't in the best financial situation. I'm simply nervous about how things are going to be as the months pass - with no income and no help. As interest collects and my credit diminishes - I see no hope. On top of all of this, six months before I graduated - the condo I owned became uninhabitable due to mold. So I'm out on the streets - no job, no unemployment, no help from my government, and lots of money to be owed. With two degrees under my belt, McDonald's won't hire me. Is there any help?"
2009-02-03 19:51:02,"Louisville, NE",Stephanie,,"I took out a loan while in school for 5,000.00. My ex-boyfriend co-signed for me. After I graduated, we continued making loan payment to Sallie Mae. In June of 2007, my ex-boyfriend broke my leg and we split up. I was unable to work for almost 2 years due to the extensive damage done on my knee. I told Sallie Mae that I wasn't working due to having this happen and they were very rude about it. They asked if I had doctor's proof, police report, all that info. I told them yes, but they still said I had to pay it now or face garnishment of my tax refund. They gave my ex a pay-off amount and he paid it to save his credit.Now they are harassing me for the remainder of the amount. I told them that I just started working and was trying to get caught up on everything. I asked them if they wanted me to rob a bank to pay them and the lady said, ""I don't care how you get the money but you owe us the money. Call me when you get back from robbing the bank so we can make payment arrangements."" What nerve!! This is causing stress, depression, and worry that I won't receive a refund this year that I need to pay off behind rent and utility bills. I am a single mother of two kids and am having a hell of a time staying afloat without the constant harassment from them."
2009-02-02 21:17:24,"Temecula, CA",Kelly,,"I started school in April of 08 and could not make the payments I needed to the school, so I got a student loan out from Sallie Mae for approx. $4,000.00. My payments started and they were 25 or 26 dollars... I got a letter in November saying my payments were increased to $165.57... I was outraged. I am still in school (full-time) and I don't have a job. How am I supposed to make those... I spoke to so many different people telling me, ""Don't worry, you have plenty of time to fax us a letter requesting,"" my payments to be decreased... No problem. I did that. Got a letter back that my payments were decreased to $35.36. Great... December comes around and lo and behold, $165 is taken out of my bank account... I called and it took nearly one month to get this refunded. I asked them BEFORE they refunded me if the payment was going to be delinquent and again they say, ""No, no. The next payment for $35.36 will be taken out in January!"" January comes and again, $165 is taken out of my bank account... overdraft fees galore!! So I call back trying to get the difference refunded... No problem... I call Mon. morning and I speak to a lady and no refund is supposed to be given back, so I asked to speak to a supervisor. She gets on the phone. She is looking over my account and after about 20 min. she says it can't be refunded or my account will be delinquent. I told her I just wanted the difference back. I'm going to make the payment of $35.36. She tells me that since I got last month's payment refunded, I still owe a payment of $165. Isn't that the REASON I faxed in ALL OF THE PAPER WORK to get these PAYMENTS DECREASED!!!!?? I even told her to get my recorded conversations with them and review them. She quickly dismissed me! Needless to say, I hate Sallie Mae. I even regret going to school. It has caused me and my husband (who is overseas) so many problems... I wish I had enough money to get out of this thing. Oh one more thing, I now owe (8 months later) over $500 in interest!! I have had so many problems with this company!!"
2009-02-02 21:00:39,"Roswell, GA",Karla,,"My husband has been paying on a $3,500 loan for over 8 years now. We just filed our taxes and got told that our refund will be delayed due to the Sallie Mae loan. Over the years we have paid thousands of dollars to get this taken care of but it never does. Last year we even agreed to have the payments directly taken from his job... we still owe over 2,000!!! How is this possible? Whenever we call we just get told he is behind... we have been paying this loan forever!! If someone could advise us on what else we could do, Sallie Mae I feel is taking advantage of people... We even became homeless back in 2006 for about a year due to this!!!"
2009-02-02 17:42:17,"Huntington Beach, CA",Amy,,"I suspect them of multiple unethical practices regarding my current student loans. One example is two private loans that I paid the full balance on, received a letter of PAYMENT IN FULL only to realize that they continued to charge me interest. When I inquired about the new balance on these non-existent loans, they stated that the interest was charged before the payment posted to my account. That is completely inaccurate. This kind of behavior has been going on frequently in too many cases to even describe in this letter. Someone needs to protect the student who is just trying to get an education from being taken advantage of by these companies. Please contact me if you wish to hear more information about my situation. I know there are several complaints pending. I am happy to help however possible."

It has been difficult dealing with my physical problems, but I am close to my goal. I am having problems with Sallie Mae recognizing that I am a full-time student and that my loans are in deferment. They refuse to note that my school faxes them the necessary information every quarter. Two excuses they offer are: (1) I can only hold a deferment for five years, and (2) I must pay for the month between semesters for Christmas break - this despite the fact that I use this time for my school work as well.My school, the San Francisco Art Institute, says that Sallie Mae is awful to students and the collecting group who is harassing me does this to all students. I have a high credit rating, and I have never defaulted on anything. The attitude of those who represent Sallie Mae is terrible. Of course, I never get to talk to one person. It is always someone else, and none of these individuals seem to know what they are doing. What is going on???"

I am so upset I can't even speak with these representatives anymore.
2009-01-30 01:00:33,"Roseville, CA",Erin,,"I am a co-signer on a loan with Sallie Mae for my brother. My brother has defaulted on this loan and I am stuck paying the nearly $500 a month fee to try and salvage my credit. It is impossible to get through this company's voice mail tree hell - calling them is a nightmare in itself. However, I called because I kept receiving phone calls regarding the bill needing to be paid and I had just sent in a payment for $487 dollars. Once I finally reached a customer service representative he told the money had been applied to other portions of the loan that I was not a co-signer on and that it was my fault for not specifying which account the money needed to be applied to. I have never had to indicate what loans to apply the money. Of course the money should only be applied to loans I am co-singer for...? I asked to speak to a supervisor and the customer service rep refused to transfer me. He became rude and then said he was going to hang up on. I demanded to speak to a supervisor and then he hung up on me. Sallie Mae is the most difficult organization I have ever had to deal with. They are rude, hard to get a hold of. They have impacted my credit greatly by reporting late pays before I even knew the payments were being made. My credit has gone down over 100 points."

2009-01-28 01:58:23,"Los Angeles, CA",Jayson,,"I started paying my student loans back in 2005 and $150.00 is debited automatically at my bank account for both private and Stadford loans. On Fall 2007, I started going back to school to take additional classes and my school contacted Sallie Mae without my knowledge saying that I am back to school. After this conversation between the two parties, Sallie Mae deducted some amount on the monthly payment that brought it down to $77.00/mo. Since I never gave them written or verbal authorization to stop any payment on both of my loans, I didn't mind having lower payment. After the fall semester. I stopped going to school and my school didn't call Sallie Mae to inform them about my status. After a year, I received a call from Sallie Mae informing me that my account has been delinquent for over 200 something days. I did talked to a woman last 1/22/09 around 5:30PM and asked how will I be delinquent when I have automated payment every 12th of the month. To make the story short she didn't care if I did not send any authorization to stop the payment all she care is to get me off the phone and agree to the forbearance which I have no idea what it means. They claimed that they sent me numerous letters informing me about my loan. Since they still taking money out of my bank, I assumed that the letters were incorrect. Since Sallie Mae decided to stopped the payment and put me in delinquent status, my credit is now ruin forever."
2009-01-27 18:02:51,"Glen Burnie, MD",Thomas,,"Well where do I start, I know and my husband knows that this should have been paid a long time ago. We settle way back to pay 89.00 dollars several years ago. We thought that was okay, but we were informed that the interest was accruing and what we were paying did not help to get this loan paid for so they, I guess, put us in collections because they needed more money and at the time we could not do anymore. So we were not paying and went into default. I have tried several times to settle with Sallie Mae to pay what we could. They would not budge and still are not. They sent my account to three different credit places for collection. Finally we were able to pay 200.00 a month to Progressive Financial out of Tempe AZ, which we gave them the necessary acct info to be withdrawn monthly.Come to find out today 1-27-2009 that Progressive sent it back to Sallie Mae for non-payment and I received a call from Acct Receivable Management and other collection agency. Meanwhile NCO Financial is calling also??? What happened to the arrangement we have with Progressive. Needless to say, Acct Receivable Management Services, because I cannot settle for 2 payments of $2,135.00 of a balance of $4269.90, are today going to send it back to Sallie Mae for refusing to pay. She gave a payment as low as $1,200 to pay today if her manager approves it. We can't afford that chunk. Meanwhile what happened to the settlement I made with Progressive. Please I hope I explained my situation. Please we are trying to be reasonable as far as our pocketbook right now can go. My husband is an independent truck driver. I do not work due to personal issues. This has once again put a strain on me and him. We want to try to come to some agreement to work this out (we thought we did). Meanwhile, interest is accruing every day, and the balance is getting to be more. There is probably more, it is so confusing. Please help."
2009-01-26 22:35:53,"Cape Coral, FL",Karen,,"I first spoke with a woman named Payton. She quickly dismissed me. She kept turning off the microphone so I could not hear the conversation she was having with the manager. She was not good in her timing and could hear them making fun of the people having a hard time paying their bills. Their statement was, ""You should have heard the excuse from this guy. I don't care. He just needs to pay. I don't feel bad for them. They just have to pay their bill."" I called Sallie Mae looking for some help because I am now unemployed and I am having difficultly making my payment. I have asked for a forbearance and they stated that my payment was low enough and that I should just make the payment. It is only $52, when you don't have it is a lot of money. Maryanne stated, ""I don't know why you just don't go out and get a job."" If it were only that easy. I have applied for many jobs in retail and grocery stores, and their response is all but the same. I happen to be over qualified for their position, and they don't know why I would be interested in the position they have open. I have tried to explain so I can pay my bills and have food for my family, nothing is beneath me. This is too much of a risk I have been told. ""How can I be sure if I hire you will stay with us? We do not want to waste our time on you. We cannot be sure that you will not take a job if you are offered one in your field."" This explanation did not satisfy the Maryanne one the phone. She just replied it is not her fault that I don't have a job and can't pay them. I need to get money from my parents, grandparents, friends, neighbors, or other family members and just make sure that I get them their money. She then continued to threaten me with the statement they will continue to call me at all hours and send me letters letting me know just what they will do to me if I don't pay them now. I am not looking for a way out of paying. I just want help in this situation to get back on my feet."
2009-01-25 03:49:10,"Coventry, RI",Dustin,,I had missed some payments with them and they called me and said if I paid a forbearance of $100 then the loan would be put to current... I paid the $100 x 2 (I have 2 loans) and the very next day they called and said that the loan was late because the forbearance only brought it up to 60 days late and they stated it would be current over the phone... They do not need to obey the laws because our government allows them to write the laws... This country is a joke.
2009-01-23 01:29:05,"Bridgeport, CT",Ritta,,"Sallie Mae needs to be investigated. I had no idea that there were so many complaints about this company. At first, I really thought it was just me, but I see that it's not. So aside from the fact that they call me like I stole something from them, they are really rude, from the regular customer service rep to the so called managers. (I really dont think these are managers anymore from reading other entries.) So this all started in July 08, I think. An SM rep called me for payment, which I didnt have, of course (laid off after 6 years). So the rep tells me all I have to do is verify my contact info and I wouldn't owe anything until this year. So I gave him the same info he already had and that was it. Mind you, he called me at my house.So my sister called me today and says that SM has been calling her job looking for me a couple of times today (she co-signed). She gave me the number and I called them from work. Waiting, waiting, waiting, still on hold. I'm missing phone calls, idle at my desk waiting. So after about 15 minutes, I hung up. I got home around 6:30 and my sister called again and said SM called her job again and the woman, who keeps calling, told my sister that they are going to start taking money away from her check. Mind you, they havent called my house once. This lady that kept calling needs a serious attitude adjustment. So I called again and I got an answer in 10 minutes. (This all just happened about 30 minutes ago.) I spoke to this thing posing as human and she is close to snorting like a bull. Loud, rude, mean. She talked to me as if she birthed me. She tells me that I owe a large payment today. I asked her why I havent received notice of anything. She says, ""Well, I have had your record on my desk"" and blah blah blah. She is so rude I had to tune her out for a moment. So I told her I cant make a payment today but I can in a couple of weeks. She then starts throwing all types of threat at me, like Your loan will go into default, and we will garnish your pay and your sisters. I'm ready to jump through the phone right now. So I asked to speak with someone else. (I couldnt deal with her anymore.) She didnt even put me on hold. Next thing I know some guy gets on the phone and he is no better. Rude for no reason, he asked me if I could make a payment right now and I said no and all hell broke loose with him also. Where do they get these people? I hung up and called back again, waited for a while and spoke to someone a little nicer. This SM rep didnt listen well though. I still had to make a payment but it was for 1/2 as much as the thing posing as human told me. I asked to speak to the head of their department and a Diamond was put on the phone. I made (well I think I did) a complaint about this Denisha person. These people have some serious issues. They treated me like I said I wasn't going to pay them at all. I just wanted a payment arrangement. A Class Action Suit is needed and I think this is the perfect time. Finally, large corps are being held accountable for their unfair and sometimes unlawful practices. Sallie Mae falls under the same umbrella. They should be held accountable too. There are some many complaints about them and it stems from all aspects of the company. How can the people on their board continue to give their consumer complaints a blind eye? I know that if we all make an effort, something can be done, as it is well overdue. I have a couple of ideas on how to get the ball rolling. If anyone is interested, you can email me at **. I wish good luck to all Sallie Mae victims."
2009-01-22 23:07:32,"Phoenix, AZ",Martha,,"Working with these people has been a nightmare. In the past, they've sent me statements that requested incorrect monthly payment and after I paid the amount requested, I was put in collections and charged $780 in late fees every month. The same thing has happened again. My salary has been reduced due to economic hardship by employer so I couldn't make one $670 payment. I have been charged $780 in late fees the past 2 months and now owe $2,230. I've tried calling several times but either get stuck on their CRM or transferred to India. They can't be allowed to do this. Please help!"
2009-01-22 22:31:31,"Marietta, GA",Myrna,,"My daughter's Sallie Mae loan began at 38k. Three years later, it's 69k. They will not help settle a payoff. Her interest rate is 14.5, monthly payment $918. She is unemployed. Fortunately, I did not co-sign. I am considering mortgaging my home to payoff her loan."
2009-01-22 13:42:23,"University Place, WA",Michael,,"To bring my account up current to Sallie Mae, I paid on 1-16-2009 a payment of $412.81 from my checking account to Sallie Mae. They showed that the payment was put through and processed to go out. Then the next day or so, I checked their website and it showed I was still in delinquent and my payment did not process, but I owed the current amount and the past due which should have processed on 1-21-2009. I called them and they said my bank could not find my account and it was their fault for not processing the payment correctly. I gave them the routing # and bank account numbers correctly. It seems after reading these articles that everyone here seems be having a problem with Sallie Mae in some way or form. I have their overnight address and will be sending this overnight hopefully not to have it return because there is no such address. Be it known I wish there was something we all could do as this is not good customer service. We all are having problems with Sallie Mae and you're not alone."
2009-01-21 18:33:21,"Holmen, WI",Vincent,,"In December of 2008, I received a letter from Sallie Mae claiming I had missed a payment in November of 2008 which meant I no longer qualified for an interest rate reduction on my loans. I first checked my bank account to make sure the check cleared; it did. Then I called Sallie Mae at the number listed above. I was told by, I believe, his name was David that my payment was received but it was applied incorrectly, which I am fine with; human error happens. He then said he would have to report what happened and see if I can still be qualified for the interest rate reduction. This process was said to take fourteen days. I did not hear back from anyone until I called today, 1/21/09, and I was told that nothing can be corrected and that I will not qualify for a rate reduction. I do not understand how I should be punished because of their errors, but need further assistance in solving this situation. Thank you."
2009-01-21 03:29:24,"Lubbock, TX",Randy,,"I went to a trade school 6 years ago to become a heavy equipment operator. The school was in Mississippi. It was a 6-week course. Financing was not set up until after 1 week in class. Guess who the lender was? You guessed it, Sallie Mae. The cost of the school was $10,000.00 with a guarantee of employment in my area. After school ended, the employment never began. That did not stop the bill from coming in. We had one hikup in the middle of things where I tried to fight back. They just tacked on legal fees and smeared my credit. I still am not working in the field that i was trained in. As of today, the debt has increased to $11,406.57. I have been paying on this debt for 6 years. If there is anyone out there looking to fill the wagon for a ride to Washington, I will definitely ride along.As I am a 53-year-old man and looking forward to retirement someday, maybe I might be able to retire. I don't look forward to dying and paying right up till the end. This has been a hardship and a burden on my wife and me. If they had not scarred my credit so bad, I could have gone to an outside lender and refinance the note, but, as you can see, it is no longer $10,000.00 but now is $11,000.00 plus. The credit and the growth in the debt actually scare prospects off. It would be nice to get these people to allow me to get away from them and just start over with a lender who possesses some integrity and genuine concern for proper business ethics. Sallie Mae has none of these qualities. The only way that I am going to pay this thing off is to get away from Sallie Mae and I can't."
2009-01-18 02:15:29,"New Castle, IN",Vinalee,,"I have inquired about my student loans by letter twice, one letter dated for 12/5/08 and the other one 1/6/09. The 1st letter was asking Sallie Mae why I have been paying for 2 years and my loan is not getting lower. I have one loan that is combined of several as I was in college for a total of 6 years. The 1st one, which I call the biggie, is about $34,000, and the other one started out at $3000, and after paying on it for 2 years is at $2551. I wanted some answers only and they send me these papers showing when my last payment was made and when my next one is due. This also included my balance and interest rate at the bottom of the page. My second letter which I hand-wrote to Sallie Mae was approximately a month later on 1/6/09. 5 days later, I received a statement from Sallie Mae saying my payment is overdue and that I now owe $287.34 which is now due immediately! Guess what? My husband makes the payments or writes out the check anyway, and when I told him, he said, we have that paid a month ahead. I looked at the coupon booklet, and yes, the next payment is not due until January 27th, 2009.I am not sure what they are trying to pull with me or anyone else. However, I do know that as a Social Worker, I worked hard for my degree, and as we all know, it was not free either. Oh, did I mention this, my payment went up from $100.18 to $181.15. This was a question I had for Sallie Mae as well that did not get answered. Will someone please call me and explain why my payments went up? Do you think I received a phone call? These letters written were done because I am tired of making the phone calls! All I want is some answers. I don't think that is too much to ask for."
2009-01-16 23:45:50,"Chicago, IL",Nafeesah,,"In the summer of 2005, I graduated from college and I had a deferred status for my student loan. Around early October, I received a phone call from my job that I was being let go due to budgetary reasons. Not even 24 hours later, the deferment expired and then I started getting swamped with mail and phone calls about repayment. I called them once and said that I had just lost my job and the people were so rude they just acted like I was saying it to get out of paying my loan back when in fact I did lose my job. Why would I joke with something like this? I actually lost my job that I had for 8 1/2 years. The job market since 2005 has been really tough and here it is 2009 and it's even harder. I haven't been able to secure a job that pays me enough to make the regular monthly payments. Just a day ago, I received a letter from Sallie Mae threatening to report the delinquency to the credit bureaus - as a tactic to scare someone into repaying their loans. How can they be allowed to bully people that have lost their jobs and are unable to make the payments? I feel that this needs to stop and that Sallie Mae should not harass students who have explained to them that they had lost their job and were unable to make or continue payments. There should be some clause to suspend because right now there are countless college grads over the last 3-5 years who are having a hard time finding a job to make or continue making payments due to cutbacks and layoffs. This is something that's out of many grads' hands and they come to work and later get hit with the pink slip or a letter telling them their job is terminated due to budgetary reasons. This leaves a lot of college grads in the dark of what they need to do next so they can keep up with their bills. I didn't even qualify for unemployment benefits so I could make my monthly bills.I pay my bills on time, but this student loan has really sent me and others to the poorhouse and seeing how the company is playing a lot of games with people, this tells you that it's going to take a class-action lawsuit to send a message to these companies that students who graduate ARE not trying to avoid repayment. Many of us are victims of this economy which began tanking since Bush came into office in 2000 so many of us are getting the butt end of the deal by being left jobless and having to be harassed all day long from 8 am to  9pm M-F and even on weekends. It's like some of these companies won't let up on the weekends so it's generally all day everyday 7 days a week.I can be home on a weekend and I'll get a mysterious phone call and Sallie Mae won't identify themselves and will block it from your caller ID just to get you to answer the phone. Plus not to mention the endless mail harassment that goes on every day. Many people who are struggling just to keep up with their bills are having to sacrifice student loan payments to pay for rent/mortgage, lights, and phone because nobody is going to be homeless for a loan company who's CEOs make more than the average college graduate. You have shareholders who have no idea what many of us are going through right now.This is a travesty. I shouldn't have to wake up every day to this and my family sees what it's doing to me and they're sick of hearing the phone ringing and some prerecorded message saying, ""This is a courtesy call, please call Sallie Mae at 800-***-***"". It's becoming unbearable at this point. I know I am not the only college student at this point who's fed up with the constant harassment by phone and mail.I am aware that I owe money, but what I don't need is the harassment for it. To see how Sallie Mae is also resorting to harassing the co-signers as well which is getting ridiculous; my mom gets harassing letters from Sallie Mae since she co-signed for my loan, but she saw after I lost my job how hard it was to find work after that because so many places were folding and I wasn't getting hired due to having too much experience, not enough experience, and, ""We're not hiring right now."" It's sad and it's a travesty that in the midst of all this, college students are enduring a lot of hardship and even more with Sallie Mae harassing them on a daily basis."
2009-01-14 14:43:09,"Wooster, OH",Renee,,"Several months ago, I filed a Total Disability Application on my student loan. I am disabled now and have a pending disability case with Social Security. I was told by Sallie Mae that it would take a couple of months for the investor(s) to either approve or disapprove my application. In the meantime, I was told, not to worry about my loan in default and that it is taken care of. Well, I had to call again, 2 months later because I hadn't heard anything from them and my loan was getting further behind. Again I was told not to worry, that it was taken care of and my application of Total Disability had no news yet. I have been locked out of my account on line several times and had to keep calling the toll free number, which you never get anyone to speak English and they have heavy accents, to unlock the account. Well, in December, I find that my student loan is now on my credit report and is in past due by 4 months now so I called again, only to be told that my application for Total Disability was denied and how would I like to make a payment?! What?! I never received a letter stating that I was denied nor have I received anything from them stating that I could defer or file forbearance. I asked if they would send this information regarding my denial and go ahead and file for forbearance. They said that they would send it out in the mail. To this day, I have never received anything yet. I am tired of getting the runaround and being locked out of my account and not being able to do anything about this. This has been a constant problem with Sallie Mae. I have not received any help at all from them, only more heartache. They also told me that they would have the negative account taken off my credit report. They haven't done so yet. What can be done?"
2009-01-13 15:36:07,"York, PA",Lisa,,"On October 21, 2008, I forwarded to Sallie Mae Servicing checks totaling $2,956.00 to pay-off my student loan which was in good status. My pay-off balance was $2,831.52 according to Sallie Mae's account system. I received a letter from Sallie Mae acknowledging the pay-off. Based on the over payment, Sallie Mae owes me $126.23 which they claim was deposited in my checking account on December 30th. This is not true. I advised Sallie Mae staff that my credit union statement does not indicate an ACH deposit from Sallie Mae. Sallie Mae staff was unable to provide me the banking institution and routing number for the account they are alleging they deposited my refund. After several telephone calls to Sallie Mae customer service department since November 2008, I am still being told they are looking into the matter. Sallie Mae Servicing is refusing to pay me the overpayment I am due. My last contact with Sallie Mae Customer Service was on January 12, 2009. Thank you for any assistance you can provide me."
2009-01-12 19:33:15,"Roxboro, NC",Marie,,"I applied for Sallie Mae loans through the encouragement of the Nursing School I attended because I had good credit but did not qualify for TAP/Pell, etc. Well, $56,000 in loans has now turned to over $120,000 total (which won't be paid off until 2028). My original payment was $554 a month, then I paid off a $1,300 loan and consolidated the rest (1 Federal/1 Private). My payments are down to $436 per month (still more than my rent). I have that amount automatically debited (14th of each month) from my account, so when I have some extra money, I send extra money when I can. Their website states that if you have extra cash and want to lower the principal, you can, as long as you send instructions that it be applied to the principal balance. I did this and even put it on my check along with a note. I decided to check my account online only to find that they actually paid off the interest (from the debited day - 14th to the day they received the extra payment) then placed the rest on my principal. They did this with a second extra payment the next month (out of $120, $118 went to interest). I called today and spoke to 4 different Supervisors and none would change this and place it all on the principal. They couldn't understand that this really wasn't helping me because ultimately, it isn't really helping to bring down my balance; they insisted it does. After numerous attempts to explain, they stated that if I had made the extra payment on the same day as my debit, then it would have been applied to the principal. Ummm... if I had the extra money at the same time the debit is due, I'd have made the extra pay. She then proceeded to belittle the extra amounts. Well, its only $150. I'm sorry BUT to me, $150 is a large amount of money. If that is an insignificant amount, Sallie Mae must be paying her pretty well. After going round and round, I told her I would be filing a complaint with the BBB and anyone else who would listen because I know they've had problems legally in the past and that they can continue to debit my account and I'll hold on to my meek $150 extra payments until it adds up enough that I can pay them off. I thanked her for her time and stated I needed to go contact the BBB. They do have several complaints also logged with them."
2009-01-12 01:31:38,"Bradenton, FL",Leeann,,"My ex-husband and I consolidated our student loans (1/4 mine, 3/4 his) for total of $42k with Sallie Mae in 1997. We divorced 4 years ago and I have a court order stating he is to make his portion of the payment. He has not made a payment in 2+ years and now, it is delinquent. Sallie Mae only calls and sends me letters, not my ex-husband. I have offered Sallie Mae to pay off my portion of the loan and asked to be taken off the loan. They have refused. I have the money to pay off my portion. Sallie Mae had listed me on the loan on my credit report for 6 years. I was advised by the family lawyer not to pay it off until I can be removed from the loan. It is ruining my credit and I am unable to do anything. I can't be the only person who is getting stuck in a Spousal Consolidation because that is why they are no longer available. Any help would be appreciated."

Despite numerous attempts by both Amanda and myself, we are unable to obtain statements or payment coupons or any kind of assistance from calling.

2009-01-10 17:06:26,"Crawfordsville, IN",Kim,,"My experience is the same as Ann's (the attorney). I signed for a student loan for my son. When he finished college, he set up payments to be automatically debited from his account. During the next 4 years, his company transferred him three times. He diligently completed paperwork to let his creditors know his new address. Then he kept money in his old account for 2 additional months to let paperwork catch up. He would then close the old account. His car loan, insurance, cell phone carrier, credit cards, etc., NEVER had trouble switching their records to his new account. TWICE Sallie Mae has slammed his credit and mine, saying his account was closed with no notification. He and I BOTH have dealt with rude people at Sallie Mae and it's been OBVIOUS English is NOT their first language (why are government-backed loans going to offshore customer service call centers???). I have been told I am not allowed to talk to a supervisor! We won't EVEN get into the 10 and 20 minute hold times. I have offered to fax or email them PROOF that notification was sent about the account change. I have offered to have the bank CALL them and verify the new account is valid. They don't want to hear it.This last time my son moved, he notified everyone in July 2008. Given Sallie Mae's problem in 2006, he left the old account open until December 2008. We found out this past week that Sallie Mae AGAIN never made the change. Ding! On credit ratings. Again. I have been on the phone for nearly 4 hours this past week. Again bad, broken, garbled English. Total denial on their part that they dropped the ball. Total denial that I could prove paperwork, prove there is a valid account with a debit authorization for Sallie Mae. I then said I would just pay the loan off. Enough of this being jerked around. I was told I couldn't pay it off and that I could only make the monthly payment. What?! I demanded to speak to a supervisor and was told, ""We no to do these for to you talk to"" garble, garble, garble. Kid you not.Okay, I lost it. I was screaming on the phone. Hey, I'm a laid back old hippie. It's not like me to turn the air blue and rattle the windows. I truly lost my temper. I had to threaten to get an attorney and call my Senator before I was put through to a supervisor. I convinced the supervisor to let me pay the account off. I authorized the transfer of funds on Jan. 7th. The transfer was completed on Jan. 9th. On the evening of Jan. 9th, I got a hate email that I was being charged late fees by Sallie Mae. I called them (22 minute hold). I think I was told that Sallie Mae doesn't credit accounts for 2 business days, EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE THE FUNDS IN HAND. Again, this person had a thick, THICK accent. VERY hard to understand. I've yet to see any change in the balance of this loan on Sallie Mae's web page.The bottom line is that my son and I have done EVERYTHING by Sallie Mae's book. THEY fail to do their part for which he and I suffer."
2009-01-10 00:42:04,"Fountain, CO",Dolores,,"In August 6, 2008 I called Sallie Mae to get a current amount owed on my student loans so that I may pay it off in one lump sum. I was given an amount owed and sent a cashier's check for the amount due as of August 6th, 2008. I did express mail the payment and received a receipt from the US Postal Service showing that my letter with the cashier's check was received by Sallie Mae on August 7, 2008. I called Sallie Mae in the second week of August when I saw my payment had not yet been posted. I was told that it takes a few weeks to show payment and that I should wait a while and check again. Several weeks passed and no payment posted.When I called again, I was told by Sallie Mae, ""What payment?"" Since then it has been a flux of letters, faxes and bad phone calls. I have the stub of my cashier's check to Sallie Mae and I have the receipt showing someone from Sallie Mae received my letter with cashier's check enclosed in it. I had the bank trace my payment, but the cashier's check was never cashed. I have no idea how the A/R Department works at Sallie Mae, but all pieces of mail should be accounted for daily. Sallie Mae lost a $17,000.00 payment.Now Sallie Mae says that I owe them four months' worth of interest on an account that I had paid off in August. Where can I go to officially complain to Sallie Mae, and who at Sallie Mae is held accountable? Now I have to spend more money and time fighting something that should have been taken care of four months ago."
2009-01-09 19:04:47,"Bensalem, PA",Jessica,,"Each semester this company repeatedly harasses my parents and myself regarding the status of my loans. I have been in graduate school for over a year and a half. I was told by the company that I didn't need to fill out any paperwork for the in-school deferment because my school is a part of the national clearinghouse program. However, every semester they begin to charge me, stating I am not a student. I argue with them and send them faxes of the school forms stating I am enrolled for yet another semester (even though my original forms said I am enrolled at least through May of 2009). Then this past summer, they said those forms are not the right ones (even though I got them from their website), and that I had to pay them all summer long. Even after I told them they acknowledged receiving the appropriate forms back in the beginning of May, but they said these are no longer the right ones even though they are the same forms I have used every semester. I paid, which meant a steady diet of ramen all summer, and then come September Sallie Mae posted that I have been in deferment since May!! They are doing it again this semester and I can no longer stand dealing with this company. I called them back today to try to explain it. The customer rep actually hung up on me mid-conversation! Their customer service is deplorable and I am desperately trying to find a way to refinance my loan with a more reputable company."
2009-01-08 15:20:35,"Bellingham, WA",Robin,,"I cosigned on a Sallie Mae student load for my husband. I was told that after 2 years of on time payments I would be removed as a cosigner. After 2+ years of on time payments, I contacted Sallie Mae and asked to be removed as a cosigner. I was told that this would happen but it didn't. I was divorced a little over a year ago and my ex-husband has made 2 late payments. I am trying to get my name removed from the loan and Sallie Mae is refusing because they say the loan now has had late payments. Even though the divorce decree lists my ex-husband as the responsible party for his student loan, I am responsible for the payments if he defaults if Sallie Mae won't release me. Since Sallie Mae refuses to recognize that I made a request to be removed from the loan when the loan was in good standing, I am seeking legal assistance to get my name off the loan. Sallie Mae refuses to even give me a copy of the loan documents stating that until I make the late payments they won't discuss anything else. One manager of the Sallie Mae customer service department even hung up on me when I asked to be transferred to their legal department! Why can this company behave like this and go completely unchecked... don't we have laws and protections in place to prevent this type of predatory collection practices. I have phone logs of up to 5 phone calls a day from Sallie Mae for over a month's period. This is well over acceptable collection practices. Can anyone offer advice or help???My credit has been negatively impacted by Sallie Mae. I have been harassed by Sallie Mae's collection department, yelled at, received excessive phone calls, and threatened. I want to get Sallie Mae to stop the harassment and remove me as the cosigner since I requested that I be removed when the loan was in good standing and was promised by one of their customer service representatives that I would be removed."
2009-01-07 22:58:30,"Marysville, WA",Doris,,"Sallie Mae has no clue about customer service! I have two loans with them, one for my government loan and one to cover my schooling that was left over. The extra loan totaled about 1,200 dollars. After graduating school, I started looking for a job and even moved to an area where jobs are more available in order to find work. Knowing that this might take some time, I called Sallie Mae and talked to a woman who was very nice and sent me out paperwork for a deferment or forbearance (I will also say that before this that they never called me; they always called my co-signer and gave out my personal information; my co-signer had to call me and then I would call them back and they would assure me that they had my phone number on file). After the request for a deferment, they kept sending me applications for deferment even emailing them to me. I filled out and sent in the same paperwork 4 times. Then my co-signer called me to tell me that they were calling him and saying they were going to garnish their wages as well as take their tax return. I called Sallie Mae and found out that they only applied my deferment to my government loan and not the small loan and that they could apply it to that loan when I paid 2 loan payments which I agreed to do within the month. I asked to have them stop calling my co-signer and they transferred me to collections and the woman I talked to was the vilest person I have ever dealt with in my entire life! I explained to her my circumstances and that I had made payment arrangements with the other agent and she would not stop saying, ""Do you know you haven't paid your loan??"" and, ""Your loan is 2 payments behind""? I told her that I was under the impression that it was under deferment to which she replied, ""It is under unemployment""? I asked her name and she wouldn't tell me. I asked for her manager and she said she was the manager. I then asked for the person in charge of her, I was told, ""That's not going to happen!"" I asked what more she wanted from me; I made payment arrangements and she said, ""I want a payment now! And I will continue to call your co-signer until a payment is made."" She immediately said, ""As soon as this phone call is over I am going to mark your account with refused to pay!"" Then she hung the phone up on me. I tried to make a complaint on line and it sent it back as unable to take it. I have never had so much trouble with a company! They never give you the right information and when you take the move to correct something that they never informed you of, they verbally assault you. I am aware that Collections can be difficult work, but to berate people who have paid and are trying to make things right is poor business practice. I don't know if anything will be done about this or not, but I do know that from a leading student loan financier, I expected much more!!!"
2009-01-07 18:36:28,"Christmas, FL",Michael,,"12 years ago, I went to college. I'm poor so I needed financial aid. The BCC told me that I had to fill out a loan application and that the loan was flat fee. Why did I need to fill out a loan application to receive financial aid? So I began to repay the loan in about 1996 by way of Sallie Mae and paid on it for 3 years. Then another problem arose and I ended up homeless for almost 6 years. I had paid to Sallie Mae approximately $1800 that apparently didn't get paid on the balance... Then the state put a garnish on my wages without a hearing and took my tax refund, and claimed I owed over the $5400 that I originally agreed upon. To top all that, I worked for a degree that the BCC didn't give me and they now claim there's no record of me attending college..."
2009-01-07 18:11:42,"Whittier, CA",Martha,,"I am very much interested in the class action suit against Sallie Mae. Please contact me! My younger sister has also become a victim of their schemes. All she was trying to do was get a college education. I also have student loans (through Nelnet), but they're quite friendly and reasonable when I've called them. Has anyone tried to consolidate and go to another lender? This company needs to be put out! She's 24, losing sleep, becoming depressed and anxious. She should be starting off her life on a happy note, not one full of future anguish. Lets get together and get this monster under control! Please do something, Ann from Pennsylvania!"
2009-01-07 10:02:48,"Vicksburg, MS",Tamila,,"I have not paid on student loans that I received back in 2004 from the school. Well, I didn't receive them; the school did. I started school in Nov. 2004 and left school in Dec. 2004. I told the counselor that I would be leaving school b/c I wasn't making it with my dad and that I was moving back to Mississippi. They knew I was leaving. They even gave me a copy of my transcript so that I can try to go back to school here in Mississippi. A year later, I received bills from Sallie Mae for two loans totaling a little over $5000.00. I asked Sallie Mae how much of this money was sent back to them since I left school so early and the rep told me, ""Oh no. They get to keep the money b/c so many students leave school and this cost the school money by them doing that."" I asked her, ""So I am paying loans back that is putting someone else through school?"" They are very rude when you try to get information from them. The rep even was asking me if I got any assistance from the govt b/c of my two young children like child support, food stamps, etc... I was in total disbelief that they were asking me this and then she was asking me if I had a car, how much I spend on groceries since I didn't get food stamps, how much I pay people to take me back and forth to work, etc... I am outraged! Someone needs to investigate Sallie Mae and soon before they go too far. I want to know what I can do about my loans. I don't have a problem paying what I used, but I know it was not over $5000.00 worth b/c all ITT Tech gave me were a few books and a calculator! I also heard that they were/are under investigation for some kind of fraud dealing with Financial Aid. It's online. This is another reason I chose not to attend the school simply because I found this out about a month after attending. Please help me on what to do!"
2009-01-06 23:06:16,"Phoenix, AZ",Teri,,"I have been calling Sallie Mae since July 2008 to receive a hardship deferment because I am unemployed and can't work right now due to medical reasons. They told me they mailed out a deferment in September to the correct address. I did not receive it! I also tried to get online to fill one out and the website does not recognize my social security number. I called again in October and requested again a deferment. Once again, nothing in the mail! I called again in November and requested a deferment. Again nothing! I just requested it for a third time in December and am still waiting again. During this time, Sallie Mae has now reported my loan to collections. I am in the middle of purchasing a home, so I have somewhere to live. I am searching for a government loan company to consume my loan so I can start paying it off or consolidate it. I think it's time for Sallie Mae to pay for their faulty practices!!"
2009-01-06 00:06:34,"Hawthorne, CA",Natasha,,"I graduated in 2007 with my BA. I didn't even get the 6 months grace period that I was told I would get. They came after me right after graduation. I have never seen a company so MONEY HUNGRY!!! They stalk you at work and at home. They claim that I am $125,000 in debt and they want payments of $981 monthly! HUGH? I don't have that kind of money!!! I called them to get my payments lowered (when you call them, they make you wait FOREVER) and spoke to someone who was a mean ol **. She told me in order to lower my payments, I need to make 2 consecutive payments and then a processing fee of $150. WHAT!? That means you want me to give you $1,962 plus $150. WOW!!! I told her that I just could not do that. I said, Well, can I do a forbearance? She said pay $981 plus $150. UGH! I cant afford that. She put her supervisor on the phone (and I should have gotten the ** name) but she told me that if I have a job, why is it so hard to pay? I told her that if I pay what they are asking, I would go hungry and homeless, not to mention naked. She laughed and said, Well, get a second job. Theres got to be a McDonalds or fastfood place in your area. I told her, I need your help not badgering. She got mad and said, Well, I will just mark this down as CUSTOMER REFUSING TO PAY. I told her I am not refusing to pay, I am asking for help and she hung up. Sallie Mae always calls me from different numbers. I have gotten calls on the weekends, even Sunday nights and as late as 9-10pm."
2009-01-05 22:59:17,"Philadelphia, PA",Ann,,"I am an attorney and I'm considering filing a personal legal action against Sallie Mae for problems I've had with the company, but I am also considering a CLASS ACTION SUIT (if anyone is interested) because I have heard countless stories of people having problems with Sallie Mae that seem to amount to fraudulent or otherwise unlawful billing practices. I've had various problems with Sallie Mae over the past two years, similar to those people who have posted complaints, stating that my payment (paid through SM's online system) was never received (my bank even called them out one time and told them they were lying and never requested payment from my bank) or changing payment due dates and listing my payment as delinquent even though they sent me a letter only two weeks prior saying my next payment wasn't due until months later (when my loan was on in-school deferment). At one point, they even sent my loan info to my brother (who has no relationship to my student loans) who lives four states away from me... and I wasn't receiving the information I needed because of their negligence (or purposeful actions). I only know one person who has loans with them who hasn't had similar problems with them."
2009-01-04 04:10:21,"Lockport, IL",Chris,,"I received a loan through Sallie Mae for my career back in July of 2005. I've had lots of billing issues and continue to have problems with them. As far as I know, I received the following: career loan, Stafford loan, Stafford unsub, Stafford sub, and another Stafford unsub. I was paying my career training loan at first, which was around $100.00. On 1/12/2006 a new loan had gone into effect (FFELP?) and I was never notified that it had started. I kept paying the career training loan ($100.00) because I was never notified that a new loan had started. My payments went up to $147.33. Because I was never notified of the payment increase, I kept paying on the original amount of $100.00.About 6 months later, I have a bill collector call me from Sallie Mae stating I was very behind in my payments. I did not understand this because I never used to get any payments in the mail and always paid my bills by looking at my account online. I was never contacted about my payments going up. I just now started receiving bills in the mail lately after filing complaints with them. When I was contacted by the bill collector that day, I explained that I was not aware that a new loan had started and payments had gone up. I got passed around to many people on the phone that day and when they looked up my account, they all told me it was a fault on their part because I was never notified about a new loan starting.After talking to many people, I finally got transferred to their manager. I don't know her first name, but I wrote down her last name and it was Mrs. **. She had me fax a bunch of paperwork, which I did at my wife's work. I was promised that everything would be taken care of and all my late fees would be wiped clean, which they were and all I had to pay was $103.25 to bring by balance up-to-date (which I still have the receipt for). This was paid on 4-30-07 by credit card. So I thought everything was fine and was happy to get everything resolved finally.My wife and I have been trying to purchase a home. When I ran my credit, it was showing Sallie Mae reporting that I was late in July (60 days late), August (90 days late), September (60), October (90), November (120), December (150) and January (120). I was never late on ANY of payments EVER. The reason they are showing this is because I was not paying the full amount, which I had never known about (I still paid the $100.00 through these months showing late on my report). I contacted everyone who would talk to me about this matter and still has not gotten resolved. Oddly enough, the manager I talked to does not exist anymore. Neither does the billing office that messed up my billing in the first place. I was told this by Michelle **'s office (888) 545-4199 ext **.If I would have been notified about a $50.00 increase, that would have been no problem at all. No, my credit is all messed up because of their billing practices and they don't care at all. I've contacted the BBB (case #**) and they were not able to do anything either since the people that were supposed to resolve this are no longer employed with the company or that billing department has been closed. Now my life is being affected very badly because of THEIR MISTAKES. They stated they will not retract this from my credit, even though they admitted fault. Believe me, I would have paid an extra $47.00 if I knew that's what I owed. Everyone I have talked to have been rude, except for a lady named Burnidine, who worked in Mrs. **'s office.Sallie Mae is horrible and I'm not the only one with these issues. Thank you."
2009-01-03 19:51:50,"South Windsor, CT",Gregory,,"I faxed them a letter requesting for my monthly payments to be lowered and spread out the length of time for the loan to be paid off. They returned a letter quickly saying that it was lowered to the min. monthly amount possible. I was very happy about this because I was facing hardships. The next month, I got a bill for the old amount. They say I never signed a form to lower the amount even though there was nothing evident for me to sign and the letter said it had been lowered and not it was going to be if I signed it. Now they say I have to re-fax a request to have it lowered again but I can't now because my payments have been late because of my hardship."
2009-01-03 16:01:28,"Dushore, PA",Sharon,,"My dealings with Sallie Mae have been the similar to those who have complained. I have a student loan, along with co-signer for my daughter, and have been harassed since college completion. I even filled out forms to have payments direct debited from my account. They said NO, because I had an amount in arrears. I called and tried to reason with them and have the direct debit amount taken and then I would catch the arrears up (under $350). They said NO. I offered to have direct debit with an additional amount taken - again, NO. I am beginning to believe Sallie Mae does not want payment, that they thrive on past due amounts and extra interest - for a government agency, they are definitely not there for the people.Sallie Mae's unwillingness to work with me has caused undue stress, sleepless nights and worry that lead to panic attacks. Why has congress not looked into this? Why are they allowed to continue with their deceptive practices with no consequences? What do college students need to do to get someone to look into these practices?"
2009-01-01 03:52:40,"Cedarburg, WI",Todd,,"My wife took out a loan with Sallie Mae a few years ago. We have been paying on the loan, but with another child on the way in a month and my medical premiums and deductibles going way up, we decided to do a forbearance. The employees at Sallie Mae told us we needed to make two months' payment (September and October) and send an additional $50 processing fee. They told us to fill out the paperwork they would send us and the forbearance would be approved. Weeks went by and no one sent the paperwork to fill out. My wife called over and over to try to get the paperwork sent to us (very difficult to actually talk to an actual person). Every time she talked to someone, they were always rude and told her the paperwork had been sent. We finally received the paperwork for the forbearance about six weeks later. We sent it back and were denied after they said we were approved. When we tried to get the 50 dollars back, they said it was non-refundable. Now all the time, they requested a payment for Nov and Dec. We have sent the payments but don't know if we can afford them when the baby comes and my wife is out of work. This company is a complete joke. I only can hope someone can see all these complaints before they do any kind of business with them."
2008-12-29 20:04:31,"Soth Windsor, CT",Michael,,"After multiple attempts to prevent my private loan with Sallie Mae from going into Default (which still hasn't happened, but is late).  I have my federal loans with Sallie Mae currently in economic forbearance, have paid on a smaller private loan with them.  Have paid on a private loan with Citibank (with whom has been willing to work with me).  And another smaller loan with the University I graduated from for $1500.  You would think that a company would like it if you did everything you could to keep debt from being late or going into default.  But the person at Sallie Mae's collections department told me that in order for them to help me in doing any kind of adjustment to payment arrangements, my account would have to first either be late or go into default.  This seems a little shady to me and inconsistent with the general practices of a loan agency or company.  I have tried multiple times over the last year and a half to work out some kind of payment arrangement, temporarily until I can obtain a better paying job.  As it is, the private loans I have with Sallie Mae have no cosigners and was approved under my own credit.  The fluctuating interest rates have been between 13% to 9% just in the last year.  The payments that Sallie Mae stated that are due monthly of $850 on my private loans exceed more than half of my monthly income which is $1700.  This constitutes as extreme future hardship, not only on myself, but also on my child and spouse.  My wife is unable to pay anything on this as the purchase of the house will be entirely on her credit.  Any legal help would be helpful.Currently there are no immediately pending garnishments nor unauthorized withdrawals from my bank account because I will only give Sallie Mae my check card number.  But my credit is poor as a result of the constant negative comments from my creditors.  This has inhibited me from being able to purchase a house and indirectly, ruining my marriage."
2008-12-23 02:06:31,"Somers Point, NJ",Marie,,"My Bankruptcy was discharged and as soon as I got the paperwork I faxed it over to Sallie Mae. This was December 5th. I called them about 10 times after that to see when it would be proccessed and was told something different each time. I wanted them to process so I could file for a finacial hardship forebearance. They finally procesed it on December 21st and I was told I had to make a payment on January 5th. So, I faxed over my finacial hardship forbearance application today, Decemeber 22nd, and low and behold it was denied the same day within a few hours.  I called to find out why and was told that I had to make the last 2 consecutive month payments and then I would be able to apply for it. However, I did make 2 consecutive payments before the bankruptcy, which were in August and September. I was not allowed to pay them in October and Novemeber due to the federal and state law and them not giving me access to my account or accepting any payments. They expect me to pay them January 5th. I asked to speak to a supervisor and when they would transfer my call I would magically get disconnected. This happened four times. I don't have the time to sit on hold for over 10 minutes at a time and then be hung up on after asking for a supervisor. They said I needed to do 2 consecutive month payments for October and Novemebr and when I notified them that by law I was protected from those months, they told me I had to make 2 future payment in January and Febuary in order to receive my forebearance. I am already under a lot of stress and am being treated by a physican for sleep problems to do finacial hardships I am still having. My fiance was let go from him job and I am picking up the costs he can not afford now and can barely pay our rent. I am already depressed and can not afford any more undue stress from Sallie Mae. I will not be able to pay them January 5th and I guess then I will start getting all the phone calls everyone else does. It is completely illegal to ask me to pay for the months I was protected by the bankruptcy law."
2008-12-22 22:48:56,"Gainesville, FL",Bill,,"I cosigned on my daughter-in-law's loan for her daughter, my granddaughter.  Our granddaughter dropped out of school a semester and has been trying to prove to Sallie Mae that she is indeed a student again.    In the meantime, we get harassing calls threatening that they will report us to a collection agency (I am in my 70's and am on a fixed income.) Not only that, but they do not send out bills monthly, but only when that month is delinquent and it is time to pay the second month.  (We have been paying until the drop-out mess is cleared up.)  The last bill was due on December 15th for both November and December, which was double the monthly payment.  This has happened more than once.  We just received another threatening letter (written Dec. 12) that we were delinquent on the payment due on Dec. 15th!  I checked my bank and the check for both Nov. &amp; Dec. was received and cashed on December 15th. There is a paragraph in the letter stating Any payment presented to Sallie Mae pursuant to a disputed sum or balance, and with respect to which you demand complete or partial satisfaction for a loan for which you cosigned, shall be sent to only the folliwing address....  There is another paragraph above the one I just quoted which is too long to include (it is under the heading of Customer Service) which says ...When you provide a check as payment, you authorize Sallie Mae either to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account.  Help!  This harassment is causing much stress for my wife and me, besides the fact that I am in very poor health, and between us and the kids for whom we co-signed.  What can be done?  This is turning out to be a nightmare for all concerned! Also, we have been thinking it is always the daughter-in-law's fault until my son told us that many more people are experiencing the same thing, and I saw the complaints on the website.   Also, it is very difficult to deal with these people on the phone.  Some are very rude, and one hung up on me."
2008-12-22 21:36:40,"Austin, TX",Chuck,,I'm getting flooded with phone calls from Sallie Mae.  I've never done business with them.  It is absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to contact a human being at this organization.  Try it!  I'm considering filing an harassment complaint against these people.Filling up my voicemail.  A half hour trying to cut through their phone menu to a human being.

They will not release an itemized statement to show what I have been paying and what the interest rate is. The only time I get a statement is when the payment is late - then they call multiple times during the day to all of my phones.  They even call references my son used from over 5 years ago!!  My son went to Art Institute of Phoenix - I feel their student loan officers were inept and purposely misled us - I was told that after payments were made for a full year then I could be removed from the loan. That was innaccurate.I do not know the TRUE balance and interest rate for my sons loans, so am unable and unwilling to refinance without the facts."

2008-12-18 04:21:04,"Tacoma, WA",Rebecca,,"Due to financial hardships, I fell back on my loans from 2003 tremendously. I was having medical issues that forced me to drop out of college and quit work. I will admit that once I was able to go back to work, I was over 10 grand in debt, and just ignored it, and payed what I could on my bills little by little, sicne the Sallie Mae bill was not providing me with food or a roof over my head, it was the last bill I wanted to think about, and I did not pay it for some time. When my tax refund was garnished I started repaying my loans again. However, Sallie Mae never reported they recieved any money towards my account from my granished tax refund. I did start to pay the remaining balance on my loan. Last year, while paying on my loans, my taxes were garnished again for the remaining balance of the loan. Sallie Mae still continued to bill me for my loan. I called multiple people, sent letters, and did everything I could think of to prove the loan was paid off in full. I was even hung up on multiple times by Sallie Mae when trying to reslove this issue. When speaking to Sallie Mae, no one cared that there may have been a problem, and would try to increase the monthly payments I was to pay on my debt. Since no one seemed to care about my problem, I continued to pay the bill hoping it would just go away, hoping they would fix the mistake and send me a refund for the over payment. My hopes never came. It wasn't until this last September when my husband and I bought our first home that any hope was shed on my situation. Our financial adviser looked into my credit and asked about the strange reports from Sallie Mae, I explained to her my situation, and she said she'd look into it. A week later I recieved a letter from Nela stating that my debt, was in fact payed off. So I stopped paying on the bill. 2 months later Sallie Mae started sending me letter stating that my bills was late. I have spoken to 3 Sallie Mae representatives now (one of which hung up on me), and continue to send them a letter every week with all the documented proof that this loan is payed off. In return, Sallie Mae has put my supposed loan in Forbearance until March (since they were getting ready to send me to collections again), and sent me a copy of the original document when I first applied for the loan, as well as a spread sheet print out of what they have on my records. According to Nela, the Department of Treasury Financial Management Service, and the National Student Loan Data System (who Sallie Mae told me to call), I have NO outstanding debt on ANY student loans. Sallie Mae still seems to disagree, I keep sending them the proof, and they keep telling me that I still owe them money. What I believe happened is that when Sallie Mae stopped using SSNs as account numbers, and started issueing new account numbers that this is when the glitch in their system occured. In the letters I've sent them, I've even mentioned this politely, and no one seems to acknowledge it as a possibility. When I tell them tis over the phone, it is ignored like I never even said anything, or in most cases, this is when I get hung up on. I have been trying to get this issue resolved for 2 years now."
2008-12-17 20:46:18,"Charlotte, NC",Charlotte,,"Sallie Mae representatives and automated dialers have called me 112 times in the last 45 days.  Only 48 of those calls have contained an actual message, and 4 of those calls are from the last 3 hours.  I called and explained in detail that I wanted to know what would make them stop calling so often as I am stressed due to the volume of calls, harassed, and the answer that Adam, who claimed he is a collections supervisor, gave me was:  Because Sallie Mae is not a collection agency, they are not bound by the laws that state that they must leave an actual voice mail, that they can call as many times as they want/need in pursuit of loan payments. They will not look into the volume of calls, and are unapologetic in regard to the calls made where a representative chooses (at their own discretion, says Adam) not to leave a message.Stress, and lots of it, has resulted from this fiasco.  I requested an end to the calls, explained that I do not authorize them to call me in pursuit of this loan and was laughed at.  I feel badgered, harassed and have suffered emotionally at work and home about this long dramatic problem."

Since the Early December I have been getting 5 calls per day asking when I am going to pay the outstanding balance.  First - They have asked now three times for me to resend the documents. Second - They have no right to harrass me with this many calls. Today I recived calls at 8:45am, 11:12am, 1:15pm, 3:17pm and 8:35pmThey are also calling my parent (mom just had knee replacement) and treating them with a poor credit report and with the calls I get the are inhibiting my ability to work a solid day."
2008-12-17 00:09:53,"Lancaster, MA",Therese,,"I find their web pages to be complicated and misleading. I also find their representatives to be rude and misleading.    I was unaware that I signed up for automatic withdrawal of my daughters tuition.  I have been paying it diligently every month manually. (2500).  Sally Mae incorrectly (in my opinion not theirs) withdrew twice in one month.  My bank agreed and reversed the payment. I then tried to pay the next month manually.   My bank had put a block on them which I was unaware of.  Once I got to the bottom of this problem I resubmitted the payment.  Sally Mae charged me $5.00 in late fees.  I tried to explain that it was an error that started with them.  However, they where rude and would see no part in it.  It is only $5.00 but I was appauled at the lack of understanding and the sneaky manner in which they do business.  I believe their practices are misleading, confusing and unfair to the consumer.  A small amount.  $35 in overdraft protection and $5 in late fees."
2008-12-12 18:20:34,"Rosedale, NY",Tasha,,"I took out a loan with Sallie Mae to further my education.  The representative I spoke to at the school said that Sallie Mae will create a payment plan according to how much money you make a year.  I started making my payments 6-months after I graduated which was under $200.00. I could afford that. Then the payments went up to about $285.00 a month. It was difficult for me to pay, but I paid it. Now Sallie Mae increased my payments again to over $400.00 dollars a month and I can't afford to pay that. I tried to do the economic hardship and to get my payments lowered, but Sallie Mae does not want to do anything for me.   I don't make enough money to pay $400.00 a month and the representatives are constantly calling my job every day harassing me. I sent them over 5 emails telling them to stop calling my job or I will get fired for getting too many phone calls. I also said that if I get fired from my job, I will not be making any money so they will not get any money from me.  I definitely want to pay my loan, but I can't afford what they are asking me. I am thinking about suing them for harassing me at my job. They are also trying to garnish my wages and I will not be able to pay my rent, buy food, travel to and from work, and pay my medical bills. My headaches have increased because of stress due to the constant harassment by this company."
2008-12-11 15:31:14,"Atlanta, GA",Alexis,,"As an undergraduate seeking financial aid, I obtained loans from Sallie Mae to help pay for college. Sallie Mae was the only outside lender for my institution. Due to the fact that they have strict requirements, I had to obtain co-signers from different family members. At times, throughout my college career, I had to obtain private loans through Sallie Mae.Upon graduation, I didnt have a job right away. As of two months ago, I finally found an $11.50 an hour job; I am barely making ends meet. My student loan payments are more than 20% of my income. I contacted Sallie Mae to have my loans placed in forbearance until my economic hardship changes. I was told that in order for Sallie Mae to process that forbearance, I would have to pay a $150 fee (which is higher than my bill).Not at one time during my undergraduate experience was I told in writing or verbally that there would be a processing fee for my loans. Nor was I told in the small print on the back of my statements that there would be a processing fee.I was told by a representative that if I didnt pay this fee, this would not only go against my credit but against my co-signers credit as well.I disagree with this fee, because I was not completely unaware of this fee nor can I afford this fee. I do not have a credit card. I do not have a bank account. I have no way to pay this fee. Additionally, it is unfair that this has to go against my credit as if I am not trying to pay the debt when I am; I just cannot afford to do so right now.Furthermore, Ive waited an extra two weeks to speak to someone that should be able to help such as an ombudsperson and customer advocacy representative only to get nowhere.This fee is not only ridiculous but it should also be fraud. If a person cannot afford to pay their bill, how can they be charged for forbearance when they are barely making ends meet? Nor was this fee indicated anywhere in the promissory note processes; meaning I never agreed to these terms and conditions to begin with. Defaulted Student Loans, bad credit"

2008-12-09 16:35:58,"Savannah, GA",Josh,,When I was 18 years old I decided to go to college.  Just like many other high school grads I was unaware of the dangers of private loans.  I just wanted to better myself and go to college.  The Rep at my school got me loans through Salli Mae.  While one federal loan is managable the other private loan carries an interest rate higher than 18% with monthly payments over $800.  I could not afford those kind of payments right out of college so I put them in forebearance. Now my $40000 loan is over $78000.  Sallie Mae took advantage of me as well as several other students at my school.  They should not be allowed to offer these high interest loans to high school students who are trying to better themselves and society.  I now have double the size of my loans and I am unable to consolidate or refinance because of the damage that has been done to my credit.  My loan payments are larger than my mortage. I am being forced to sell my home and car.  I will be homeless and without transportation because I wanted to go to college.
2008-12-06 12:46:47,"Long Beach, CA",Nancy,,"I was used as a reference on a friend's student loan application many years ago. We have not remained in touch, but Sallie Mae refuses to believe me. They have repeatedly called me for several years now, and continue insisting that I tell them her current location and phone number, which I do not have. I have told them that since I was not a co-signer of the loan it is not my problem or responsibility to resolve, and to stop harassing me about it. I was appalled when recently the school she had attended called me on Sallie Mae's behalf in an attempt to persuade me to divulge my friends' contact information! I repeated to them that I have no knowlege of her whereabouts and that it was neither my business or my problem to resolve, and to not call me again. When did it become legal to harass someone other than the person who signed the loan??"

ITT gave us books that were old,Soft ware that didn't work, and Projects that didn't make any sense.  I quit ITT course because I got offended that i turned my home work in with great effort put in. Them  i saw that students that had one word answers were getting equal grades as me. ITT was passing Stupid students and not actually grading like a collage should. I was in the IT course of ITT but when i decided to build a computer from scratch to learn all the components they could not help or knew how.  Sallie Mae was more then egar to pay near 6 Plus thousand for there 2 month classes several days of which was snowed out and no insturctor showed up for class.   I paid one Sallie Mae off  and magically some how i had another that i was not aware of show up again on my credit report.   Sallie is a terrible terrible company They make you sign these documents and they get the money so easily.  Sallie Mae holds no eduction institution responsible for performing for your money or making an institution earn it.  I have paid the first not knowing of the second. if i knew i would not paid either."
2008-12-03 00:52:15,"Highlands Ranch, CO",Peggy,,"My son has several student loans. They take the money I am paying on one account and post it to another account, so I keep falling behind in payments. It makes no sense, and I question the legality of it. I have filed a complaint with the Atty Generals office in PA. Would you take my water bill payment, pay my electric bill and then turn my water off? What a corrupt organization.Most of the bills are in default, when I have been paying for them. I have their collection agents calling me from 5-6 different numbers. I DO NOT answer the phone. Odd no one has called since I talked to them this afternoon."
2008-12-02 19:50:22,"New Albany, OH",Veronica,,"I have several loans through Sallie Mae I am in the process of consolidating.  All of my federal loans are in deferrment but am still paying on my private loans.  I call the primary Sallie Mae # to set up payment, I authorize one amount, they deduct another ($106 more than authorized) Because of the holiday my account reflected as being 4 days past due.  It is 2:46 p.m. and I have received 6 calls from Sallie Mae.  I have had to explain to ALL of them that payment was made, give them a reference number, and then they just hang up.  I googled all the different phone numbers they have contacted me from and see many, many complaints regarding them.  I have just recently started repaying my loans and am terrified of how the next several years are going to pan out if - heaven forbid - I am 5 minutes late on a payment!The unauthorized amount caused my checking account to be over-drafted and I was charged $105 in over draft fees.  So essentially a $100 payment cost me $311.  Beyond that, the numerous, unnecessary calls when they have my payment need to stop."

2008-11-27 23:16:51,"Lansing, MI",Tim,,"I finished my 4 year bachelors degree and had some troubles finding a job after school. I finally found a job just 2 months before my loans were to start being paid on. After speaking to my parents and Sallie Mae (who wanted $950/ month) they insisted that I set my loans to differed. After speaking to 4 different departments I finally was told if I want to push out my loans another 6 months that I would have to spend $100 right that moment otherwise I could not get the extra time I need.  After, much frustration of telling them I don't have the money I finally just gave them my credit card and charged it to my existing school fees. With that I have been working at my current full time job in Michigan for almost 2 years. Within that time I have differed my loans once more and paid another $100. Unfortunately, I am still just barely getting by keeping my bills and my existing fees from school paid off on my credit card.  I have asked for a raise once already and and really, really close to getting another job part time. I have signed a extended loan form with Sallie Mae, which allows the payments to be low, but I that means I will have to pay even more that the $130,000 quote by the end of my payments that they so generously sent me in the mail.  I have been looking up alternative ways to get this lower and not cost so much, and I found through the student.ed. gov site that you can consolidate your loans with your vendor. To my amazement I found this quoted text on their site.    Thank you for your interest in Sallie Mae, the nation's leading provider of saving- and paying-for-college programs. We have temporarily suspended offering our private consolidation loan program. No new private consolidation loan requests will be processed at this time.     Sallie Mae's Federal Consolidation Loan service is not available at this time.  Severe legislative cuts made by Congress made federal loan consolidation uneconomical. This, combined with the credit market deterioration, has caused us to suspend participation in the federal consolidation loan program.  If you are seeking to reduce the monthly payment on your Sallie Mae education loans, please call us to explore other options, such as our extended or graduated repayment plans. These options can provide significant monthly payment relief and often at a lower cost than federal consolidation.     I don;t know what to do. I'm 80,000 in debt at a time where I am just starting life for the first time. I work 70 hour weeks salary because I actually like my job, but unfortunately just am not going to make it if I have to start paying on my loans.  What do I do?If I don't start paying my loans I will be going into deferment and will have my paycheck garnished by the federal government.  Not only, will I have to move away from my job, or get another job, but I will be paying this loan off for the rest of my life and still will owe Sallie Mae when I die."
2008-11-25 23:17:29,"Paw Paw, MI",Jennifer,,"My husband attended an out-of-state university and when getting a loan on his own for the first time, they pushed Sallie Mae on him. Without thinking, he signed up. today, he has over $67K in loans from them and over teh past 3 years has incurred over $7k in interest!   They are currently in defferment because he's going back to school ... but that's only for another 2 years. When he was in repayment they told him to pay $800 a month - he was making minimum wage and working part-time with no health benefits! They wouldn't budge and when he tried to get his payment lowered he was told by the company to get a better job to make the payments.  He has tried so hard to keep in good standing but the same as everyone else has falled into default several times and it's done immense damage to his credit."
2008-11-25 22:11:42,"Excelsior Springs, MO",Steven,,I have been unemployed and am behind on loan payments on a school loan. (Just a couple of payments) So SallieMae starts calling about the loan. They called about 10 times a day and also the co-signer the same amount. I talked to them and made payment arrangements but the phone calls continued.  I then talked to the supervisor I complained about the phone calls and she said they wouldn't stop until I hade made a paymnet.  So I made a payment 3 days earlier than agreed on and the phone calls still continue.  Isn't there some kind of law about how many times they can call?  Isn't this turning into so form of harrasment?  We made an agreement.  I paid the payment as agreed.  Why do the phone calls continue?It is causing mental stress on all.  My co-signer was just diagnosed with a brain tumor and has ask the phone calls to stop but yet they continue.
2008-11-25 20:20:10,"The Colony, TX",Andrew,,"I had multiple loans administered through Sallie Mae. Some were directly with Sallie Mae and others were with the Federal Goverment. For 18 months payments were made for all loans, but Sallie Maw continued to apply all payments to their loans despite repeatedly being contacted and told to apply payments as due to the individual loans.The federal loans are now in default with an additional 25% tacked on to the principal. Wage garnishment is being threatened."
2008-11-25 10:50:56,"Mcdonough, GA",Pedro,,They call 10 times a day and even after I speak with someone and tell them my situation. They still call me repeatedly throughout the day even after I arranged a payment.   I thought they would stop calling if I paid the forbearance. They did not and also messed up my payment arrangement with them. They said they were going to take out the money out of my account on  the current coming Saturday. They did not take my money out until the next Friday.   Sallie Mae is a rude and disrespectful  company. They call my job harassing my co workers threatening to contact their managers if they don't give them information about my personal life. I should have never gotten this loan.
2008-11-22 21:41:37,"Pittsburgh, PA",Danielle,,"I first contacted Sallie Mae in September of 2008 regarding my student loans, how I could not afford to pay $342 a month. I was told that I can not apply for a loan deduction or consolidation because my loans were not in repayment. So I wanted until my loans were in repayment and contacted Sallie Mae again in October of 2008 about lowering my monthly payments on my loan; I explained that I could not afford the monthly payment; I wanted to postpone my loans for 5 years and was told I couldn't do that. I was also told I could not consolidate my loans. I have called and explained my situation several times. Finally I got an employee who I thought was helping me. After spending almost an hour on the phone with Sallie Mae I was under the impression that I only had to pay $168.70 a month, which being a single mom with rent and other responsibilities I can barely afford. I mailed my first payment, but my second payment I decided to make online. I logged onto manage my loans only to find out that I have to pay 2 different loans at once that totals $367.67 a month. Since the Sallie Mae employee failed to inform me of this I am behind on payments and maybe facing late fees; they want $733 by December 13th. I was under the impression that my loans will fallow one another; I was never informed that my loans will run concurrent. Now because someone at Sallie Mae apparently did not do their job and inform me that I will be paying 2 loans a month I am really in a bind. As far as I can tell my loans were never lowered. I talked to lady about payment options and she gave me two options and I picked one, I thought I was lowering my payments. Unfortunately after graduating I have only been able to find a job working 24 hours a week, making only $9.00 an hour. Not to mention I am a single mother that has to pay rent and bills. When it comes down to it I probably spend more on bills than I am actually making. I explained that I could not afford to pay more than $200 a month on my student loans. I was under the impression I would only have to pay $168 a month. That is what I was told. I was never told that I was paying 2 loans at once. I tried going to salliemae.com and clicking on the links to lower my payments, postpone my payments and so on, only to get the run around through the website and then come to a dead end. I was even told I dont qualify to have my loans in deferment. How do I not qualify? I am single mom working 24 hours a week. I now have to take the time to call Sallie Mae to straighten this out, which unfortunately will probably do nothing. They will just tell me I have to pay the money. I have been graduated for almost a year. I have yet to find a job. I now feel my degree is a waste of time and money. I wanted to go back to school to better my life. But it has only put me financial hardship and caused an extreme amount of stress. My life is harder now. The only job I have been able to get, they have kids in high school on the same pay rate. 2 years in school to better my life and I am struggling now more than I ever did. Now I am stress about the student loans. This is crazy. There has got be something that can be done about this. I need help now for this problem gets worst. I can't afford to have them take my tax return I am counting on that to pay off other debts that occurred all because I thought going back to school would better my life. I cant afford to have anything else on my credit. I have been trying to clean my credit score. I cant believe this, $30,000 and 2 years to work 24 hours a week making $9.00 an hour. Believe me I have been looking for a job non stop since I graduated. Now I get the pleasure of dealing with Sallie Mae to pay back loans for an education that has not even gotten me an interview. I have only made one payment and the problems already started. Dealing with Sallie Mae so far has been a joke and I am seriously considering filling a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. No wait I am going to file a complaint and everyone else should do they same. I really hope all of you who take the time to read this will also go the Better Business Bureau www.bbb.org and talk about your experience with Sallie Mae. Maybe it will help, maybe it won't, but it is worth a shot."

2008-11-19 19:45:58,"Vancouver, WA",Krishta,,"In 2005 I took out several SallieMae loans for my education. After graduation, I placed the loans in deferment until I found a job in my field and was able to pay. One of the loans, much to my confusion did not defer, and instead went into default. I tried and tried to work with SallieMae to place it back into good standing, which they refused and ultimately sent it to an outside collection service. In March of 2008 I paid over $2700 as a settlement on this account (meanwhile ALL my other student loans have been paid on time and as agreed)which should have satisfied this loan. SallieMae then took the balance from the settlement and reapplied it to my existing loans, applying some of my payments I was making toward the amount that was already settled! I had no idea this had even happened until I received yet ANOTHER collection notice from a different collection agency stating the same loan I settled on was defaulted AGAIN! When I showed proof of my settlement letter to the collection agency, they stopped collection, but SallieMae treated the balance as a charge-off and reported it as such to all the credit bureaus! This has been a nightmare! I don't know what to do against this beast! They've proven to be unethical and highly unprofessional in my situation. Please help. This has been reported negatively to all the credit bureaus and has hurt my credit immensely. For over eight months now they have been reporting it as delinquent and defaulted, never showing the settlement, and now is as a charge-off."

Over the last two years I have recieved phone calls or reports to my credit that my account was delinquent.  Multiple payments are not being posted to my account correctly.  I have called and emailed requesting that a hard copy of my account history be mailed to me, however, I have yet to recieve anything in the mail from Sallie Mae. All I want to do is pay this loan off, however, because they post my payments incorrectly, I never will.  I have requested that a new coupon book be sent to me so that I could keep up with the history of my payments better, but then they don't send the coupon book and when I send in a payment with no coupon, it makes me even more suspicious of how my payments are being applied.  I see lots of other complaints identical to mine on this site, but I fail t see any answers.  Please advise.   I can't win.  Numberous phone calls regarding delenquency.  This is causes unwanted and unneeded stress in an already stressful economic situation.  My credit is all that I have and they are ruining it."
2008-11-19 05:56:31,"Buena Park, CA",Mary,,"In 1997 I applied for DeVry.  I was told I could apply for a Federal loan.  I attended DeVry for four semesters.  I suffered a nervous breakdown due to my mother's health and dropped out.  I was told I had borrowed $9,916.86.  The loan was through AFSA POB 7051 Utica, NY 13504-7051. I filed for bankruptcy in 2001.  I was contacted by a very arrogant male from Nevada.  We have you No bankruptcy can protect you  I contacted the individual.  I allowed this as I know a bankruptcy doesn't protect you with Federal loan.  I agreed to pay this.  In addition, I was told this was a Federal loan from a Devry counselor. I began making electronic payments of $200 to a USA Funds for a student loan.  My bank has all this information in 2002.  I made these payments for approximated two years.  I was then told I would no longer be electronically paying this and the original loaner would be taking over.  I never found out who the loaner was. I thought it was AFSA.  Anyway, I have been making payments of $80 to Sallie Mae for over five years.  I still owe $9,200.  In all these years I have paid a little over $700?  I have contacted them and told them I need to get to the bottom of this.  I read recently, they buy student loans and then double them.  All these money handlers.  Almost like loan sharks.  My concern is that this amount is not going down.  I figured that at $200 per month to USA loans should alone have covered money for interest.  For one year should equate to $2400.  That would bring the loan down to at least $8000.  Now paying $80 per month for even three years should bring the loan down to $7000.  They claim they are charging %5.3 interest but this can't be.  I still owe $9,213.  I feel as if I am going to be paying $80 per month, possibly even more and will never even make a dent in this.  I need some sort of legal help in this matter.  I have been taken for over $3000, this should have taken some off this loan.  I went for four semesters.   AFSA was on my bankruptcy papers.  USA loans found me through them."
2008-11-19 02:42:36,"Chicago, IL",Russell,,I borrowed money sometime back to go to school.  I also used my grandmother as a cosigner.  We both have done everything within our power to make payments and make everything with Sallie Mae current.  I have paid small payment having them deducted automatically from my account each month.  I have paid numerous forebearance fees.  Sallie Mae will not stop calling and when they do call they are so rude. I hang up everytime in tears and it makes my grandmother a nervouse wreck.  When borrowing the money I never imagined that the economy would be in the condition it is in when it came time to pay back.  Today they called and I spoke with 2 supervisors that proceeded to tell me what I loser I am and one even called me a dumbass.  I can't pay the $1800 they want per month...I offered a payment but that was not good enough so the supervisor on the phone says to me then you are refusing to pay and we will put these in default.  I can't sleep or eat becasue of the stress of Sallie Mae calling me.  It bothers me more that they will not leave my grandmother alone.  They start calling by 8AM and call all day until about 10PM.  This will destroy both of our credits.
2008-11-19 02:16:49,"Orlando, FL",Latippinea,,"During my years in college 1992-1994 I secured student loans from Sallie Mae. After completing school and paying on the student loans (off/on); I decided to return to grad school to obtain my Masters degree upon entering my college of choice, I was made aware of Direct Loans (government agency that gives student loans at a very low interest rate). I immediately took advantage of this opportunity, quickly completing my application to transfer my student loans from SallieMae to Direct Loans and to utilize Direct Loans as the current lender for loans to return to school. The process went well - I never heard anything negative from SallieMae until 09/12/08 when I pulled a credit report (yearly) check and noticed that SallieMae placed a bad debt charge on my credit report (1st timer ever) which, was during the time the transfer had taken place. I telephoned SallieMae and questioned them about the legality of this incident. I made them aware that this was recently placed on my account and is inaccurate. I requested they do an investigation to verify this claim. The gentlemen stated to me that I must prove to SallieMae this did not occur.I am appalled that a company (anyone) can legally falsify claims against others and there be NO consequences. I have tried everything and have not been able to obtain cooperation in this matter. I hope that someone can shed light as to the answers/steps in correcting this!My credit is reuined!"
2008-11-18 17:06:58,"Scottsdale, AZ",Mike,,"Upon the urging of my school and Financial Aid rep. I applied for a loan consolidation...I don't know...4 years ago in order to qualify for a lower interest rate (4.5%).  All three applications were ignored by Sallie Mae.  I did finally get one at 8% after graduation and owe in the neighborhood of 25k to Sallie Mae And sold the other 50+k debt to another company because SM is so screwy.I make all of my payments on time and for additional toward the principle every month. (ON THEIR SECURE WEBSITE)I made an electronic payment in Sept '07 for $200 and for some reason it did not go through.  So in Oct '07 I made a payment over the phone for $400.  It has been over a year now and Sallie Mae still refutes that they ever recieved any payment or that they returned it...Why would they return it?  They didn't!  I have provided proof of that payment numerous times through multiple different avenues...including three way phone calls with my bank, faxes, emails, certified mail.  My bank is now disputing this through the Feds because they know that Sallie Mae recieved the funds.  There is not one part of this story that is a good reflection of their business practices.  I have done my due diligence to prove my payment and I want them to get out of the racquet of loaning money before my kids end up having to deal with the same BS.14 Months of late fees, additional interest charges on money I paid, risk on my credit report, risk on my co-borrowers credit report, 15-20 phonecalls every day for more than a year, including my cel phone, well in excess of 160 hours of my own time gathering data and providing the proof to sallie mae...and waiting on hold, stress to a level that put my girlfriend(co-borrower) in the hospital for two weeks, complete lack of faith in the system, and a intimate understanding that Sallie Mae does not care that they are breaking the law."
2008-11-15 22:42:46,"Hilliard, OH",Chris,,"At the age of 21, I signed as a co-signer on a student loan for a friend.  His family would not sign for him and I had good credit and I figured he would be good on repayment...I did it as a favor and was too young to realize that I would eventually have problems.The reason my credit was good was that I lived at home with my parents while I was going to school and they were paying for my education...my parents did not know about me co-signing on my friend's student loan.  So, why is it that Sallie Mae will take a mere 21 year old as a co-signer without checking more into their background?  Why would they allow a kid (I know I goofed now, but I thought I was helping a friend out) to just simply sign a paper without checking to see that this Good credit was really one that could not get a student loan on my own, since I was living with my parents and my parents were paying my way through school??  As I look back, something seems very very wrong with this scenario!! The process by which a student can get funds through a way too easy co-signing process is a disgrace and I feel my own lack of knowledge (and stupidity about what I was doing) and wanting to help a friend is now coming back to haunt me...my friend is not making payments and I want to make sure things get paid off as it will show up on my credit report (I'm getting notices from Sallie Mae)...I even called Sallie Mae and offered to help them find my friend, get VIN numbers on his vehicles, tell them where he worked so they could garnish his wages, etc., I WANTED TO HELP GET THE BORROWER TO PAY!!  And the Sallie Mae people said they don't do any of that (asset repossession, garnish wages, etc.) and that I was on the hook...how could they be so uncaring??  Why would they ignore help to get the money for the paon from where it should be coming from?I am extremely perplexed about this one and just don't get it!  I am willing to pay one-half of the loan balance (about $24,000) if there would be a way for me to get off the credit and let Sallie Mae deal with the borrower after that...is that possible??  Is there anyone that can help me??  Am I being unreasonable?"
2008-11-15 17:22:54,"Auburn, GA",Kristen,,"In 2005, I attended college full time and applied to have my student loan deferred.  Sallie Mae kept billing me and claimed they never received my deferment request.  I mailed the request 3x and finally had to fax it.  All the while, they kept billing me and adding late fees. Finally, I stopped being contacted (harrassed) by them and assumed they finally procesed my request.  Until fall of 2006 when they mailed me a letter that I was going into default.  I called them and explained what happened to the representative and told him I was only working 20 hrs.per week. He told me to go find a full time job and I explained, as a single mom I couldn't afford child care and had to work while the kids were in school. He said if I agreed to have my payments debited he would erase the late fees and start my payments over so I wouldn't look like I was behind.  It didn't do any good to keep telling him I only had late fees because they never processed my deferment request.They have been debiting my account now for 2years. Last month, I noticed they were going to debit my account for 3x the amount of my normal payment and when I checked into it I found out they re-applied my late fees. They will not reverse the charges, they denied that anyone made the arrangement but won't answer me when I asked them why the late fees had not shown up on my account for the past 2 years until now. I also pointed out to them that according to their own procedure they apply payments toward any fees owed, then toward interest then toward principal but they have never applied any of my payments toward fees for 2 years (that observation was also ignored). I also realized that even though they had been applying all my payments to interest every month for 2 years, they added an extra $250 to my accrued interest each quarter. Now, I'm in the same boat with my payments.  I'm a full time student and they won't process my deferment request, won't respond to my emails regarding my deferment request. Charged me for 2months that should have been deferred and added more late fees.  On top of that, my ex recently stopped paying child support and I am seriously in debt but according to their qualifications, don't even qualify for an economic hardship forebearance. My original loan amount is $9000 but they have added over $4000 in interest.Of course, my credit that I've been working hard to improve is going to be ruined."
2008-11-13 20:56:24,"Chicago, IL",Miriam,,I am continually called at all hours of the day constantly by these people ON MY CELLPHONE. I had no idea who they were till i looked them up on the internet an found out they were a student loan collection agency. I dont know how they got my cellphone number an why their calling. Ive never had a student loan never applied for one never had one. An have never applied for one with this company never have dealt with this company never talked to this company. I dont understand why they keep calling me considering their a student loan debt collection company an ive never had a student loan. Its ******* me off because im constantly woken up early in the morning or at night by them calling me all the time. And they never leave a message just constantly keep calling me. An if i do pick up they have the nerve to put me on hold. I'm tired of them calling me an bothering me when i have never had any dealings with them or had a student loan. Must be something that can be done to make them stop.Im wondering since they have the wrong person an dont seem to care if they can touch any of my money like my tax refund or my wages. If they do im suing because ive never had a student loan or bought purchased or received anything from this company. I dont know how they got my phone number an all these complaints ive been reading from other people about how horrible an seedy they are seems thats something they would try to do. I want to know what can be done. I checked my credit report sometime ago an found things on there that didnt belong an had them removed im wondering if that happened again.
2008-11-10 16:38:45,"Brooklyn, NY",Paul,,"I've been sending payments to my loan and they have not been credited to my account. I keep receiving late fees. When I call and ask to pay over the phone using the same bank card,there is no problem with the account but they charge 15 dollars to pay over the phone.Late fees every month in which it is not my fault. I owe more money than what I borrowed. My credit history is being ruined."
2008-11-10 15:52:29,"Appleton, WI",Chris,,"I am recieving phone calls asking for a relatives name.  I told them that this is not thier home and never was. They said they are going to keep calling me until I give them their phone number.  I do not have a loan from Sallie Mae and did not co-sign for one.  I did not give permission to be a referrence for one either.  They will not listen and now they just call and ask for my relative who cosigned this loan only.  I say they do not live here and they hang up right away. I don't see how this is legal and I have nothing to do with this. This is the chain of who I was refered to to resolve this problem (which no one can resolve). I called the local police, Better business bureau, consumer protection, department of finacial institutions, Department of education office, They gave me Tammy's name who works for Salli mae. and finally the Federal Trade commision. All dead ends.I am under stress because of the constant daily calls.  I am currently reduced to part time at my work because of the economy.  I can not keep up with just daily living expenses.  Know I have these calls to add on to the stress of unemployment.  Reading this site shows that nothing will help and it goes on for years no matter what you do.  I must put up with this for life possibly?  Even though I have nothing to do with this loan! This was becasue of my sister being late on one payment which was made already.  So they are harrassing me for absolutly nothing!"
2008-11-09 20:32:23,"Oregon City, OR",Carmen,,"This is an on-going issue. I have two loans - one private, one federal. For months, Sallie Mae has been incorrectly applying my payments to the incorrect loan. Therefore, I receive delinquency notices from them. I have contacted them numerous times about there problems with not applying my payments correctly, and each time I am assured that the problem has been resolved.They are ruining my credit by saying I am delinquent. My frustration has hit its maximum level and I just don't know what to do anymore. Can you PLEASE help?"
2008-11-08 14:17:50,"Manchester, NH",Julie,,"Reading all these stories are horrifying! I too took out loans with sallie mae... federal and private. I went to cosmetology school all last year. I went full time during the day, so I needed to cover my cost of tuition as well as my cost of living (i.e. food, rent, LIFE) etc.. The total I took for the year was about 39k. THROUGHOUT my year in school I was constantly in contact with sallie mae, asking questions about repayment, grace periods, etc... They had told me that my loans could be consolidated and put on a 25 year payment plan as my private loan debt was over 30k. Extend the payments out to be able to make reasonable monthly payments. A representative told me that I'd be looking about $360 a month after my grace period. Though that is high, I could do it. So now my grace period ended on 10/31/08. I decide to sign up for the 2 year interest only payments extending for 25 years. I figure that would give my boyfriend and I some leeway with our monthly bills and allow me to get into a hair salon and build a client base. WRONG!!! Guess what? Sallie mae doesn't do private loan consolidation anymore. So that means that I am stuck paying off 46K (principal and interest) over a 10 year span of time with no option whatsoever to extend through sallie mae. My interest only payments for the ext 2 years is $367, after that it goes up to $740 a month. I'm not too sure as to what I am going to do in 2 years, b/c I can say right now, we can't afford that. And I can't afford to get a job in a salon, which is what I went to school to do.When I spoke with sallie mae (crying), I asked ""what if in 2 years my boyfriend and I are married and we want to have children. I'll be out of work for a few months... you're telling me my private loans are not deferrable and thats it?"" The rep replied ""yes."" So I am now working at an office. The entire reason I went to school for hair is b/c I hate office work... and now I have no choice but to do it b/c we need the money to pay my student loans. My hope, firstly is that sallie mae burns to the ground. My 2nd hope is that in the next 2 years our economy gets better and private loan consolidation is offered. Because if sallie mae really expects me to pay off 46k in 10 years... they have a better chance of monkeys flying out of my rear end."
2008-11-07 18:32:33,"Parker, CO",Chris,,"I opened a loan in November of 2003 for my daughter to attend Sylvan Learning. The loan term was supposed to be for 6 years. I was given a Sallie Mae loan with those terms with a loan amount of $13,034. I called Sallie Mae on November 7, 2008 to find out loan balances. My outstanding balance was $11,134. After 5 years of payment, Sallie Mae made changes in my loan terms and has only applied $2000 towards my principal amount, and applied $6000 towards daily interest. They also changed my terms to have final pay off for my loan to be 2018. I was not notified that this change had occurred."
2008-11-04 05:22:02,"San Mateo, CA",Eric,,"So after many years of wondering I decided to be a chef and go to culinary school. Like many people my only choice was to go for student loans with a co-signer. I was given an impression that many people go this route with sallie mae and perhaps in ignorance I thought this would be a very laid back process. Little do I know of the horrors sallie mae wreaks on their clients.Throughout the school year my depression finally caught up with me after my battle with it for 6 years and almost killed myself and was hospitalized for 5 days. This happened about a month or so before graduation. It was not difficult at all to get a doctor's note stating I was unable to attend school OR work. And I was also able to obtain a leave of absence of 6 months from my school on the condition of sending in a doctor's note every month.On the last (6th) month of my leave of absence, I was in the process of changing doctors with my regular on maternity leave and was unable to turn in a doctor's note. When I told my school this, they said they'd have no choice but to kick me out. Needless to say I was devastated to be removed from school so close to completion though what happened next was the big problem. Days later I got a letter from sallie mae saying I needed to begin payments that month of $700+ along with a bill for kicking me out of school, also $700+. I asked what happened to the 6 month grace period I was promised and was told that because I was technically not in school for 6 months, that that was my 6th month grace period. And talking with my school, sallie mae and various other resources, I was told there was nothing they could do. No one cared about my problem, only my money. I knew much of the world was heartless but for some reason I didn't expect student loans to be so cut throat. I had no choice but to get a 6th month deferment and battle through my depression/medication/and suicidal thoughts and look for a job. And needless to say the job market is very thin right now and now I have bills due in a month with no money. I'm terrified not only for myself but for my co-signer who with medical bills for her husband is completely broke. Are 3 lives going to be destroyed from this? I don't know what to do anymore. I'm living with my family right now and it seems I'll be living with them for a long time."
2008-10-31 20:51:27,"Milpitas, CA",Hannah,,"I received a forbearance for my account because I attended school for more than half-time and I was supposed to be on hold until October 8th. September comes around and they haven't emailed, called, mailed me a reminder regarding my account. It's as if they expect me to know when to pay. The only letters I've received were dated October 9th which detailed my payment plan to be due on the 9th of November. On the 24th of October, Sallie Mae sent me another letter telling me that I have a past due account for October, by which they never made me aware of such required payment. Had I been aware of this beforehand, I would have made my payment sooner. I feel exploited by a loan company that I am supposed to trust.This is not the first time this has happened as well, I know of several Sallie Mae debtors in my immediate family that have been blindsided by Sallie Mae as well. We are not running away from our payments but what they do is an abusive practice that should be stopped. If the company itself is honest with its billing, I would not complain but because they are shady, even though they may appear to not break any laws, it's bad treatment of their customers.The economic damage here is my credit score which they have affected by not telling me when my first payment was due. I am incensed at their nonchalance on the phone and unsavory practices. I am assuming, this is how they make their money by lending it out and placing phantom late fees which should not exist because the customer themselves are not aware that they are being billed. Their customer service representatives are nothing but buffoons handed a telephone who know nothing about the situation and refuse to rectify what they have done. I am not someone who is running away from my debts but the fact that they considered something as not making people aware of their practices is nothing short of shady."
2008-10-30 20:28:06,"Woodstock, GA",Stephanie,,"Sallie Mae has been harassing me for months. I usually ignore their calls but when I do answer to try and remedy the situation, they are rude and not helpful in the least. Last time I spoke with them, they said they were going to have my tax refund garnished. They told me I needed to pay them $250.00 that very moment to put an additional forbearance on my account. I'm pregnant and this is just adding to the stress of not being able to afford to live. I can't afford that. I didn't plan on this happening. The past two years have been hard. I haven't been working because we made the decision for me to stay home with our baby, who is now 1 year old and I have another one on the way. I work in real estate anyway, so even if I was working, I wouldn't be doing well right now. My husband has unfortunately been in and out of work b/c the automotive industry has been terrible and only getting worse. He is trying to get into another field now. I filed Bankruptcy last December because we had to use credit cards to pay our mortgage, medical bills and my costs for real estate while he was out of work and I was getting no business. They want $300 and something dollars a month. That was the best they could do for me as far as a payment goes. We can hardly make the mortgage payment right now. I don't know what to do anymore."
2008-10-30 02:17:40,"Brooklyn, NY",Shani,,"My Sallie Mae student loans have become financially out-of-control! I currently have three (3) Sallie Mae student loans, which my 71-year old, senior citizen mother had co-signed for me. The initial total amount of these three (3) loans was approximately $33,500.00, but currently has become a financially unmanageable, spiralling up, astronomical amount of $49,500.00. I am currently on SS Disability, and CANNOT make the full monthly payments. I tried to get the life of the loans extended, but Sallie Mae was of NO HELP! I am trying to make partial forbearance payments, but for each loan Sallie Mae charges an ADDITIONAL $50.00 fee per loan.I am telephoned 10 to 15 times daily, as is my senior citizen mother. My mother is on the brink of having a stroke, and I am SICK to my stomach. Not only are me and my mom being harassed by Sallie Mae, but I've been bullied and threatened into near homelessness by at least TWO of their representatives. In fact, just TODAY I was told by Josh, from Sallie Mae, that they can GARNISH ALL OF MY SS DISABILITY funds!I read that the US Supreme Court ruled in 2006 that up to 15% of SS &amp; SSD can be garnished by Sallie Mae, but WHY ARE THE CONSUMER LAWYERS OUT THERE PERMITTING THIS TO STAND? WHY AREN'T THEY FILING APPEALS TO HAVE THIS RULING RECONSIDERED? After reading the dozens upon dozens of Sallie Mae horror stories displayed in the Consumer Report Sallie Mae section of this website, I am literally confounded by what seems to begovernment sanctioned Sallie Mae loan sharks! Can't anyone out there help us???"

After my husband passed away last year, I tried to get a forbearance/deferment till I got my finances straightened out... no luck. I then offered to pay a lower amt (not much lower) than what was due monthly... no they said. I then filled out direct debit forms to have the monthly payment taken from my bank acct - get this they said NO!! NO because I had $300 in arrears. Give me a break... NO to direct debit for the monthly amt they wanted. I totally give up and would like to find a lawyer to do a lawsuit or class action suit. They are now threatening my credit even though I wanted to make payment. What do I do now?"
2008-10-28 13:02:47,"Brookfield, MO",John,,"I defaulted on my Sallie Mae student loans earlier this year. I was attending a online course and my wife and I encountered financial hardship. I have been unable to work due to a disability and my wife at the time had become pregnant and was put on bed rest for several months. Although at the time we were still attending school when we went to apply for government cash assistance and food stamps, Sallie Mae garnished our assistance. We had to live off of a little over $100 a month and $400 in food stamps to feed a family of 3.When we investigated why our cash assistance was coming up short, we were told that Sallie Mae had garnished it and that we owed them around $2000. After a few months, they took over well $3000 of our cash assistance and we're still collecting it when we left the program several months ago. We are still having hard times and have decided that we were not receiving the quality of education that we are paying for with these Sallie Mae loans and have since withdrawn from our classes so our family can survive. We receive 2 or 3 letter daily and until we had our disconnected we're getting 8 to 20 calls a day.When I confronted them about harassment, they said that they can do as they please because they are exempt from those harassment laws. On one occasion, I was even told to sell my home to pay off their loan. I live in a little trailer, and last winter we had to stay in one room cause we could only afford to heat with electricity, we had no water, no gas, no tv, just a phone with local calling so I could get in touch with my wife's doctors and electricity. We endured all of this because Sallie Mae's garnishments. Today we're still not much better off but we are barely making ends meet. If it wasn't for the local churches, we probably wouldn't have made it..."
2008-10-25 22:33:25,"Lithona, GA",Crystal,,"Sallie Mae has added ridiculous charges to my account and will not allow me to pay off my loans within a reasonable interest rate. They have denied me every right to have the ability to pay off my loans. In addition to my high interest rate, my loan which has been split into 4 have been rigged to accumulate more interest than necessary. They are charging me over 500.00 per month. I can't afford this at all in addition to my federal loans. I need help!!!"
2008-10-23 21:44:06,"Gainesville, FL",David,,"Sometime well over 6 months ago, I started receiving many calls a day from several collection agencies attempting to collect on a student loan for a name I couldn't understand. Almost all of these calls were automated so there was no one I could talk with to straighten this out. You see, I have never taken out a student loan. Recently, a live human from Sallie Mae did call me and I got the name of the person who I was supposedly a reference for (not a cosigner, just a reference and they felt that justified calling me 5+ times everyday?). I told that caller I didn't know the person that owed them money and would she please have her company stop calling me. She hung up. In fact, I have spent hours and hours on the phone with their representatives, most of them are polite with me and they all tell me I am not in their computer anywhere, and they all say there is nothing I can do to stop the phone calls.After a number of months of this, I was getting weary of having my life and even my work constantly being interrupted. I turned off the ringer on my phone and stopped answering it altogether. I do not understand how my name got in their system. My best guess is that the debtor put down someone they knew with the same name and when the collection agency went to contact them, they found my name listed in the phone book for somewhere in the same state and they entered it into their database.Ultimately, I got tired of dealing with their deceptive practice of telling me they would deal with the problem, that I was to wait about a week and the calls would stop, which of course never happened. I believe they intentionally do nothing in cases like mine, figuring I am lying and that if they just keep harassing me, I will pay the money for the debtor. Of course, from what I have experienced, even that wouldn't stop the calls.I had the choice of calling a lawyer or having my number changed and the latter was a lot less expensive so that's what I did. TWICE! I changed my number to an unlisted number and both times they were calling my new number within 24 hrs! Why is a private company given such open access to unpublished numbers? There is nothing I can do to get away from these people! If I owed them money, I could at least pay them off. But I have absolutely no options. I cannot even get the contact information of the debtor to ask them to help get my name off their list (I don't believe that would work anyways).This company and the other companies it owns, Student Assistance Corporation (thanks for the calls you make every day with nothing but recorded noise), USA Group and who knows who all else need to be put under control. They each use a multitude of numbers and I can only identify about 5 or so of them a day but I also receive a number of calls with no name or number listed that are from one or more of them. I truly feel sorry for anyone who has a loan with Sallie Mae. If they treat me like this and I don't even owe them anything, I can imagine how a debtor would be treated.They have shut off my connection to the world. I was forced to get a cell phone so I could keep in touch with work and I have to maintain the landline they call just so they won't call the cell number. I am a nervous wreck from their constant automated harassment (yes, I consider calling and playing messages of ""static"" and calling and saying they have an important message for me please call back at the following number and then providing no number is harassing). How can calling 5-10 times a day NOT be considered harassing when I have called them so many times and told them I am not the person they are looking for? Do something to stop these people! And let's all work on legislation that makes it impossible for them to get unlisted numbers of non-debtors so easily. It makes no sense for them to have blanket access to non-published numbers."
2008-10-23 14:22:29,"Compton, CA",Jacqueline,,"I borrow money for my college education. I went under a signature loan.

I had to apply for forbearance and well I was charge 150.00 dollars to extend my payments for two months. I find myself not able to afford the $545.00 a month installments. I did request to consolidate the loans but the payment are still too high at $450.00. That is all they could offer me. Can I fight this? I had to request another forbearance. I have not owed them 4000 dollars in addition to the $36,000. The second time I needed to request a forbearance, they charge me 500.00 dollars. I would like to know if Sallie Mae can do this. The problem is creating stress and financial hardships, and It may result to bad credit. I was wondering if I have a right to fight this."

2008-10-21 18:41:22,"Forest Hills, NY",Lyle,,"I had given my name as a reference to a friend of mine a few years ago. For the past several months, I have received numerous phone calls from Sallie Mae asking me for information on him. I have repeatedly told them that I am not the person, and that the person they want to speak with has lived at the same apartment and has had the same number for years. They told me that they would take my name off the list, however, I still receive phone calls from them constantly. I have my own loan from Sallie Mae, which is always paid on time. I find that their constant barrage of phone calls constitute harassment. They have the person's number and information and continue to call me. If he is in default, they should seek legal action against him instead of harassing me. I would like them to stop calling me."

2008-10-17 17:20:35,"Loves Park, IL",Pamela,,"I am a co-signer for my son's student loan. We are behind on about 6 months worth of payments due to my sons employment, and they always threaten default and wage garnishment for both of us. I sometimes answer or call back to explain the situation. And all I get from them is their rotten attitude, rudeness and downright lies. I talked with them today and told them we would get caught up and that I would be the one making payments starting next month. If you do not pay them something over the phone, they mark your account as refusal to pay, which is not true! The last payment made was in July 2008 and they never applied it to our account. I faxed copies of cancelled checks 3 times over the course of 6 weeks and nothing was done. They always said they never received it. I even faxed it to the attention of their supervisor, Stacy **. Then I had a lawyer to write a letter to get them to apply the payment to the account. They finally applied it to my account. The person I spoke to said it was applied back in July! For all the people I talk to at Sallie Mae, it's the same thing. They lie, degrade, threaten, and demand. If we would have known what we were getting into by taking out this loan, we would have shopped around. I had student loans with Sallie Mae years ago and do not recall the cut throat service these people are giving now. This is a disgrace to the college age kids out there trying to go to college. I tell all my friends with kids going to college to go any place but Sallie Mae to get their student loans.Another thing, of all the calls we get in a day there is always someone else on the phone - lying, demanding payment, and threatening default. They keep lousy records. I have asked for statements to be mailed. They tell me they can't do that. If you mail the payment, it takes weeks to get applied to the account. I have never seen anything like this in my entire life. I don't see how you can run a business like this, if it's even a legitimate business anymore. I pray congress throws the book of the law at them for what they are doing to kids trying to go to college.My son is discouraged and depressed. He is unsure of how we will ever pay this off and move on with our lives. He isn't sure he will be able to buy a car or a house because of Sallie Mae and how his credit rating is affected. It's depressing to me that we try and try to do the right thing. Then all Sallie Mae does is keep threatening. They need to be stopped and it's probably going to take an act of congress to do so!"
2008-10-17 14:32:27,"Roslindale, MA",Fransmine,,"I borrowed $7500 from Sallie Mae, consolidated the loan through College Loan Corporation. They paid Sallie Mae and its collection agencies: ACS &amp; Nelnet, a total of $14,133.13. Why are they still harassing me??? Credit is messed up!!! I keep getting letters and phone calls from its hired collection agencies, etc."
2008-10-16 16:11:34,"Marysville, PA",Lissa,,"This company is absolutely out of control. Not only is their customer service horrendous, (try to find one person there that speaks English) but they give false information and constantly harass people!)  I took my loans out for a Computer Design school with Sallie Mae back around 2004. Due to reasons beyond my control, I withdrew from school and waited the standard 6 months after schooling to start paying back my loans. At first there was no problem, but then things got a little rough so I needed to place my loans into forbearance. Bad idea!! Not only is the interest rate out of this world to begin with, but it continues to accrue during the forbearance. They tell you that you are not required to make the interest payments. Over the course of 4 years my $7000 loan sky rocketed up to $15,000! This is completely unacceptable. Even now when I am finally able to make the monthly payment they tell me that I am late! Just recently another forbearance on my account has ended. I was told that payments would start up October 5th. I called in September when I saw that I had a $15.47 past due charge on my account. The lady I spoke with said to pay that and my account would be current and the next payment wouldn't be due until October 5th. I paid another past due amount of $131.09 that was due 10-05-08. I paid this on the 2nd of October. Even as of today, my account is saying it's 11 days passed due. 11 days from the 5th is today. So basically they are stating that I didn't make a payment this month! I called about it and they said that the forbearance was incorrectly applied and that the payment I made on the 2nd of October was actually for September, and the reason I am showing 11 days past due is because I didn't make October's payment yet. I said to the lady it was their mistake but they are making me pay for it. She said she was sorry and there was nothing that she could do! What kind of business is being run here? I told her that I am tired of dealing with all the run-around. I have been dealing with it for over 4 years and I will make the payments as I see them on the account.I have since written an email demanding that I deal with only one person on my account and that I get everything in writing. They haven't responded as of yet."
2008-10-16 13:29:13,"Sanford, FL",Jennifer,,"I have been having financial difficulty for the past couple of years as the real estate market started to decline. Our income has been on and off and I have not been able to pay for my student loans. The interest rate keeps going up and every forbearance they are charging $50. It used to be every six months, now it is every two months. If you are not working, which I am not, $50 is a lot of money especially when you have 3 kids to take care of. I want my interest rate lowered so I can actually afford my payments when I do have job again. In 5 years, the principal balance has gone up $4,000 because of interest and not being able to pay."
2008-10-14 18:16:15,"Cheltenham, PA",Maxine,,"I can't believe that I'm reading the same thing that is happening to my daughter by the ruthless Sallie Mae employees that call her 24/7, harassing her about her student loan payment. She has tried to get a lower payment that she can manage and they refuse. She continues to pay the $50 to defer it for 6 mths only, adding enormous debt to an otherwise low loan. However, that option has now run out. They have my daughter suicidal and I know this has to be illegal. She has a new baby and cannot pay the loan at the rate they have it set as. She wants to pay; it is just that she can't pay as much right now. I bet nobody called those Wall Street cheaters when they didn't pay the money! Someone has to do something, seeing this is happening to so many people being harassed by Sallie Mae."
2008-10-11 22:46:05,"Scottsdale, AZ",Saskia,,"I just found out I was in default with one of my financial aid. I rang the CSR at Sallie Mae. Charlotte said I need to fax documents proving I was and still am in school. I did just that and in a timely manner. A couple of days later, I rang the CSR again to follow up on the status of my request. The CSR did not know what was going on. So I restated what kind of process am going through with Sallie Mae. He then said that it was denied because am missing some documents. Here is the thing. I never get an email stating that they need additional information regarding my Forbearance and In-School Deferment. They, Sallie Mae, just transferred my account to USA FUNDS...and USA FUNDS placed me in collection with PIONEER CREDIT...while am in school! My question is, is it LEGAL to transfer accounts like mine while it is still in negotiation or in the MIDDLE process of ""Forbearance and In-School Deferment?"" Please advise."
2008-10-10 20:05:43,"Eugene, OR",Jodie,,"Looking at all of the other posts about this company, I am shocked. My story is much the same, calls every 10-15 minutes 12-14 hours a day. All the day BEFORE a payment is due. I find myself crying every time my phone rings, dreading the number I know I'll see flashing back at me. But then if I can pick it up before the call hangs up (they usually only ring 2 or 3 times) the person on the other line is of no help.My situation is that not only am I being asked to pay back my student loan, while still in school, I never spent the loan money to begin with. I went to an airline academy trying to become a commercial pilot, but three months later, after a terrible car accident, I withdrew from the program. Now I am fighting to get the academy to give back the money I never used, nearly $40,000! Meanwhile, I am attending university and trying to finish my degree, and paying interest on money I never used.Sallie Mae is of no help, no matter who I talk to, and I've talked to countless managers. They won't even grant me a forbearance though I've given them $3000 in fees and payments to get it. I feel used, preyed on and severely depressed. How can this be legal?! Even as I write this, my phone is ringing with the standard 866... number and no payment is due for another week. All of us, the used and confused, need to get together and write our congressmen. This cannot continue!"
2008-10-10 19:05:36,"Newport News, VA",Steve,,"I started class on Jan 16 2007 at A.I.M. I have since graduated this past Aug. My situation is that I had dropped a class (general education class) in late Jan. of 07. My loan for this class was around 6,100 dollars. When I stopped the class I was told the money was going to be returned, and that it could not be used for any of my other loans. Starting in Feb of 07 I was told that I would be paying a loan deferment payment of $10 a month until I graduated - A total of $200.00 until graduation. I was unaware that the loan being returned and the loan I was paying $10 a month were the same. When it became obvious to me that my loan was never returned and I was paying loan deferments every month for this loan, and that it had a 12 percent interest rate I went to the school to talk to Mike **. Mike told me that they had every right to hang on to money for as long as they want to. I showed him in the school handbook where it says all loans not used must be returned within a specific time after the class was dropped. As of today Oct 10th my loan still has not been returned. Now I am receiving phone calls from Sallie Mae in regards to this loan. Even after telling them that the loan is being returned in full, they tell me I still owe them for the loan over a thousand dollars because the loan was never returned. FRAUD is the only thing that comes to mind. How can they hold on to a loan in my name for a class that has been dropped, in their account while I pay the bill. and then have to pay another thousand dollars on top of that! All because they never got around to returning the loan. The only one who made out on this is the school. Please help me get this straightened out."

I am up-to-date with my payments, but the monies I send are never distributed accurately. Some loans are behind while others have credits.

2008-10-09 01:27:37,"Greensboro, NC",Bj,,"My husband and I consolidated our Ford Federal Direct loans through Sallie Mae in '05. We have since divorced. Sallie Mae and the Board of Education do not allow this loan to be at all divided, in any way. We are both fully responsible for the full amount. Now I find myself a single mom, with an ex who owes 2/3 of this loan, and refuses to make payments. My credit will be tied to his for the next 30 years until we pay this off. I've appealed to my congressman, who is not able to take any action because of laws passed in 2006. I have called and called about this...the customer service is awful. I can never understand the person on the phone (although I will say that I did get one really, really helpful guy on the phone one day - thank you Brandon!), their system is incapable of automatically mailing bills to two addresses, so they have to keep my name on their desk so that they remember to mail me a bill. I am unable to set up an online account to manage my loan, because my ex took all of the information (acct number, etc), and set up his online acct access, and it apparently won't let two people access the account online. IF YOU'RE not going to divide the loan in case of a divorce, and you're still going to require that we both be responsible for this, WHY do you not make it easier to try to MANAGE YOUR ACCT?"
2008-10-08 20:57:37,"Talladega, AL",Bruce,,"I received my coupon payment book; I called Sallie Mae regarding the $90. + Payment a month. The representative at that time assured me that that was the correct amount for my loan. I continued making payments for about a year. One day I received a call from a person who stated that she was a Sallie Mae representative, and that I was behind on my loan and that I needed to pay $500 + dollars now. I informed her, that I did not have the money now but could pay it with in two months. I also informed her, that I had contacted Sallie Mae in the past regarding what I was paying and was told that was the correct amount. I stated to her, if this was an error on Sallie Mae's part, I should not have to pay for that.She was very persistent, I told her again, and that I could pay it within two months and that, I would need the new payments in writing. I do not remember if she told me what the monthly payment would be. I continued making payment with the payment booklet. I do know I was not going to give too much information over the phone. I told the representative that my home phone ** is my computer line and my number is **.I never received information regarding the conversation that occurred regarding payment or anything of an additional payment. Nor did I receive a replacement booklet once the booklet was out. I inquired about my replacement booklet, before running out. I was told that I was not going to be receiving one. I told the representative that I needed something and that I was not going to send money to and address.There was and is a lot of fraud going on at the time and I was not taking any chances?. To this end, I needed the requirement in writing from Sallie Mae. August 2008, I received a letter from a company OSI EDUCATION SERVICES? NOC Financial Systems, Inc. stating that they were representing Sallie Mae. The letter identified a Principal balance $36,800.84 with an accrued interest of $1,280.42. I contacted Sallie Mae and informed a representative of this and she stated that this is true. In addition, there was a by the way we are suing you?. She stated, We have sent mail to you four times?. Moreover, she gave me a phone number to a lawyer?, who I did not call. I never received the mail she spoke of?.However, since the phone call of inquire of NCO, I had received two invoices August and September, which indicated that the 98 dollar payment received did nothing and a $224.00 late fee was added to the account. I sent Sallie Mae a letter dispute, on the past due amount and the accrued interest and other charges applied to my student loans.Tuesday I received a letter from Sallie Mae, identifying possible consolidation on the one that is being mail in. This included the above fees. I called Sallie Mae today October 8 2008, to inquire if the letter I received was the response to my dispute. I was on the phone off and on for four hours being transferred to different people, and finally transferred to a lawyer office, with a recorded message someone will be with you soon. After 30 min. I hung up the phone. NCO is currently making $260.00 as of August from my checking account. I have not received any statement of payment receiver or the current balance on that account."
2008-10-08 01:05:56,"Columbus, OH",Jeanette,,"On September 20th I checked into the Microtel Hotel in Florence, KY for an overnight stay. I used my Debit Card issued by Sallie Mae (via Walden University). The Pre-authorization amount was $212.00. On the day I checked out, I paid cash ($150.00) in order to satisfy the room rates. On the day of check-out, Felicia called the Customer Service number as listed above in an effort to have the Pre-Authorization Hold released and provided ALL the information requested by Markus (CSR). During the conversation, Markus informed Felicia he couldn't release the hold because of the pre-authorization number didn't match what they had in their system. Felicia placed a call (again) to the Microtel Corporate Office in order to double check the pre-authorization number that had been provided her. Mind you the hold (per SallieMae is to last until November 4, 2008). Both Felicia and I were advised that they couldn't release the hold because of it being over $100.00. In several other calls to Sallie Mae (the most recent being today 10/7/2008), I spoke with Barbara (CSR) whom advised me that the Approval Code provided Sallie Mae was incorrect and in order to release the hold Microtel would have to provide an Approval Code for the $212.00 in order for it to be released. Jetta ** (Manager) called on my behalf in an effort to provide whatever new approval code was needed in order to have the hold released. Of course she got nowhere after being told (yet again) they couldn't release the hold because of the dollar amount. I have called and complained as well as two managers from Microtel. This is an outrage especially since the bill was settled with cash. I'm outraged because of the back and forth misinformation that is provided the consumer and management of an establishment."

They want information on her from me. I'm disabled, unemployable and can no longer be responsible for knowing the location of everyone in the world that said 10 years ago that they knew my name. Sallie Mae said they would take my name off their list years ago and every time we talk, they say they'll take my name off their list but still they contact me constantly at their discretion. Last year, I told them I had had enough and wanted to claim harassment. Yesterday another letter.I'm not use to people lying to me. It's just not done in our area. I've always pay my own bills. I'm sure it's Sallie Mae's intent to harass me until I pay off who's ever bill's they want me to. The address Sallie Mae gives me for the person they know is on the other side of the state. If they know who and where this person is, then the only reason to harass me is for me to pay any bills they want. I'm disabled, mostly bed-ridden, unemployable since 99. They want me to pay money I can't get. Their constant digging at me in a condition I can no longer control has made me nervous, unable to sleep, distraught, without hope or closure. No future but to wait in bed for their harassment till the day I die."

Sallie call all day bugging you even when you made a payment that they say didnt get. Im on workmen comp. We can keep making payment and Sallie said that they didnt get. We can't pay other bills because Sallie claims they didn't get the payment. I on workmen comp have high blood pressure.

Now that I am working,(I make $736 a month.) I am able to pay my monthly payment but recently three of my payments to SallieMae have not shown up and I keep getting calls saying of course I'm overdue. I get paid bi-weekly and now SallieMae calls not only me but my ex-fiancee to get money out of her and they have even tried getting money out of my current girlfriend. I make timely payments yet somehow they get lost! It's bad enough I get the run around with these people. When I ask to speak to a Supervisor and explain my case,he responds with,Ok just send us the money when you get your next check and we'll update your account. The calls don't stop there. This is stressful as they say they'll call my job to find me. Find me? I'm not running from this..I'm a 28 year old guy trying to survive and pay my bills on time!

He was unable to get enough financing to finish culinary school and had to quit half way through the program. He got a $20,000 loan and after he left school half way through the program he got a bill for $78,000.  How can this be legal.  This was not his understanding when he got the loan.  Sallie Mae is horrible.  There must be laws against such practices.  Anyway, that is for him to pursue, my problem is with their harassment of me.  Since he was no longer in school he had to move out of student housing and was unable to find a job in Altanta where he had been attending school.  He moved back here to SC and stayed in my home for a short period of time.  He gave Sallie Mae my phone number and although I have been informing them that he moved out several months ago, they still call my phone several times per day.  There were 17 calls yesterday and so far, 11 calls today.  It has been this way for months.  Everytime I tell them he is no longer at this number they say they are going to remove it from their records but the calls never stop.  These people start out nice until they find out they are not going to get any money out of you and then they become rude and hang up.  I don't know how to stop them.

2008-09-22 20:13:44,"Suwanee, GA",Shawn,,"I finished school about a year or so ago. I went through a divorce, job loss, and a foreclosure at the same time. I refinanced my student loans with another company at a lower interest payment I pay them monthly, Great. This Rosie woman calls me 5 times a day at every number. I ask that she no longer call my place of employment she still calls. She threatens to take me to court and sue me. I say fine go ahead she still calls. The problem is I refinanced the loans through a new company. My school was $30,000 for two years I went for less than 1 year. Sally Mae says I owe them $19,000.00 on top of the refinanced amount of $28,000.00 thats $47,000.00 and I did not even finish. They have no customer service and everytime the call they assume that you are going to give them more and more money. I only wish I had never attended college and can honestly recommend if you have to take a loan to go to school with Salley Mae. DONT GO join the military or something. Sally Mae is also based out Nevada where this company is allowed to break laws. This company has caused me to get written up and incresed my stress levels. They continue to call and harrass me my blood pressure medication is now need to be increased."
2008-09-18 08:24:01,"Walnut, CA",Adam,,"I had 5 student loans with Sallie Mae. I had a few consolidated and had been paying my loans just as stated on the mailed monthly invoice. No problem, well that is what I thought. I started receiving calls that my loans were some odd days late. I was not aware of this, what had happened is they just applied the sent in money to the loans that they felt they wanted to. They had requested a foreberance and they said I was out of foreberance time and they ensured me that I had some. So I sent in the money that they requested to do the forebarence.I kept recieving calls 3-4 a day and it took about 4 days to answer there call. They informed me that my forbarence didn't go threw and I was so many day delinquent and I needed to pay today to settle this dispute. I informed them that I had paid them not only the monthly payment, but the 150 more for a forebarence that was not even granted. I asked for a refund on the money for the forebarence and they denied me and just asked for more money.Then told me that I was failing to cooperate and they would notate my account. They also called my grandma she was getting harassed along with my parents. They told my grandma not even being my cosigner just on my loan as a friend/relative. That I was going to get sued if I didn't come up with the money and they put here in a situation and lied to her to try to make her pay my loan off. At this point I am not sure where to go. I get no respect at all from them and they are acting like they are just worrying about trying to get me to pay to get some sort of commission or bonus every time they can get money out of me.I just tried to make a deal with what sounded like a nice girl on the phone she claimed that I had some more forebarence time and they admitted to not applying the loans to the right loan group. So they adjusted my loans around and made my 2 current loans and my one loan default about 90 days late. So they sort of cleared the slate sort of. They also clamed that they took off all the extra charged for the defaul loan. I was happy I told them what day I could pay they were ok with that. (continuous phone calls) I answered a few days later and they were asking for another payment. I had to explain what we were doing, she said that it was not going to work and I was even more late and if I paid at that date that I setup the loan was going to default again. I got a call the next day and they wanted to arrange more payments.  I told them when I could pay and they kept telling me that I was not cooperating and I was resisting to pay. They call me starting at 8am and really don't stop all day I am tired of this I now have 2 loans with them because they keep screwing me.   I have build up so much unneeded stress they talk to me on my phone for at least 30min + at a time which is even charging me more, Sleep deprivation, verbal attacks and threats on the phone,   depression, emotional damage, and created a huge financial burden that they have no intent in working out with me, They seem to enjoy my loan slipping out of my grasp. All I want is to have my good credit back and they are the only reason that I have bad credit."
2008-09-08 23:29:06,"Cotopaxi, CO",Holly,,I have spoken to Representatives with Sallie Mae several times to sort out my loan repayment.  Each time I have asked for them to remove me from receiving email statements and asked for paper statements due to the fact that their website is very difficult to navigate and I can never get clear information on how much I owe.  Plus I have a difficult time even downloading the email.  I even set up a one time payment about a month ago thinking that that would end the harassing phone calls which I receive on average 4-5 an hour everyday of the week. Unfortunately the phone calls continued.  Also when I answer the calls a recording says to stay on the line for a representative.  Then they hang up.  I don't understand why this organization thinks that their constant calling will get them their money any faster.  I feel that they are using harassment in their attempts to collect because they feel that there is nothing we can do about it.The consequences for me aren't anything economical and physically only cause me severe frustration and worry.  I am trying to pay them what I can but I'm out of work now and my husband was just recently employed after almost 2 years of unemployment and is making less than what he made 8 yrs ago.  I'm struggling to do the best I can to get by just like millions of other Americans trapped in this rotten economy. All I ask is that they send me the information I need to make my payments and stop harassing me with their constant phone calls.
2008-09-06 16:57:03,"Rockville Centre, NY",Robert,,"I have been paying my student loan promptly for over 10 years.  I have also been making additional monthly payments consistently for years.  I switched my online banking and provided Sallie Mae with the new information online (two times) so that they could start taking the automatic payments in my new bank account.  They never applied the new information and I contacted them several times by email and on the phone.  I also faxed them a copy of my voided check on two occasions and they finally applied the payment.  I discovered that they increased my rate 1% and charged fees because the full payment was never taken.  One payment was applied because I had additional payments set up as a recurring payment every month so that I would reduce the term of the loan, so they did get that payment.  I wrote to them and told them that I would like the fees to be reversed as well as a reversal of the 1% increase in my rate.  They refused.  This was their error not mine.  I tried to give them my account information several times via phone, online and fax.  I have an excellent payment history with them and have never had a late payment in over 10 years.   I incurred fees as well as an increase of 1% of my student loan rate."

These people will not answer a questions, they will not put you through to a supervisor.   They will however, become rude, try and demean you an hang up when they can't get their way.    If you or anyone you know is trying to obtain student loans, DO NOT ALLOW SALLIE MAE TO BE YOUR CARRIER.  I asked someone named Brian what amount is due to bring all accounts up to date thru the end of Sept 08, so the next payment would be due in Oct, 08. He gave me a figure and I used a credit card to bring this account up to date (I thought). 3 days later my son was contacted again and informed his account was deliquent.  He called and even through he had a confirmation number it did not matter, they wanted more money NOW or they will report it to the credit bureau."
2008-09-06 02:49:01,"Newalla, OK",Tommy,,"After I earned my BA, I enrolled into a Masters program at my University.  During the second semester of my Masters classes, I was promoted at my job and subsequently had to withdraw from class.  The Universiy reported my withdrawal and Sallie Mae determined that the beginning of my 6 month grace period would be retroactive back to the beginning of the semester.  They sent me a Bill for my payments that they decided to start. I called them and they told me that it did not matter that I attended until late in the semester, I had withdrawn and that was the same as quitting school and that my payments would become due.  I told them that I was still enrolled and that I needed an in school deferrment. This was the 22nd of July, 2008.  On the 31st of July, I recieved the paperwork.  I had my college send the information. They deny ever recieving it eventhough my college has mailed and faxed it several times.  In the mean time they are starting collevtion activity and assessing me late fees and payments.  I think that they are stalling on purpose just to generate more revenue in late fees.Late Fees, and continued daily harrassment."
2008-09-03 17:46:14,"Acworth, GA",Aubrey,,"After graduating from DeVry in June of 2006, I had several loans from several lenders, including Sallie Mae. I worked to get everything consolidated, and ended up with 2 loans - one with Sallie Mae and one with another company.  Through a series of miscommunications, both loans ended up part due by a couple months. I continued to send payments, but the loans were perpetually past due. This went on for a year, all of this time receiving dozens of calls from Sallie Mae daily. Customer Service agents are very rude and hang up on you if you try to protest anything they say. Any attempts to placate them by saying you're working on it and trying to get caught up results in Can you pay the past due balance in full? No? We are going to default your loan. An then they basically hang up on you.  In December of 2007, my parents refinanced their house, and as they have a good bit of equity, used a portion of it to obtain funds to pay off the Sallie Mae account and be done with them. My mom (cosignor on the consolidation loan) spoke with a customer service supervisor who agreed that a portion of the accrued interest would be waived, and gave us a payoff amount reflecting this. The accrued interest was roughly $1300. The payoff amount was just shy of $27000. We sent them a check for the $27000 and though all was over and done with.  And then the collection letters and phone calls started again. Customer Service agents are even more rude now and when I try to explain the situation all they say is we have no record of such an agreement or any phone call relating to paying off your loan. They refuse to waive the $1300 (all interest) as they agreed to, and have since capitalized that interest and added it to the principal, so now the interest (that was supposed to be waived) is collecing interest. They now refuse to contact or speak with me by anything but telephone even though the telephone is how we ended up in this mess. I tell them I will not communicate in any form except writing (including email) and they say they will not communicate except by phone.  At this point my outstanding balance is just over $1400 and it seems I have no remedy. I don't have the ability to pay the $1400, and don't feel I should have to, as a supervisor agreed to waive it and provided me with a payoff balance, which we sent in.Trashed credit report, inability to obtain other financing."
2008-09-03 12:03:46,"St Charles, MO",James,,"I graduated back in December of 2007 so 6 months from then is when I would start making payments on my loans through Sallie Mae.  They never mailed me anything with what my payment amount should be until middle of July and it said my payment was due by August 10.  My co borrower contacted me shortly after I received saying he got something in the mail saying my loans were in default.  I immediately contacted Sallie Mae about this issue and said you that I was not sent anything until the middle of July and it said first payments were due in August.  Since this I have been in contact with Sallie Mae several times a day trying to bring things up to date. My co borrower and I both have made payments in which they applied the money to the wrong loans.  I have a forbearance in place for some of my loans which they don't go back to being active till October.  After my co borrower made a payment August 13th Doug who he talked to said nothing is due again until September 8th.  But 2 days after they payment was made I was contacted by phone from Sallie Mae saying I was again in default.  Between my co borrower and I we have been hung up on several times.  Yesterday I was told because of the economy being in a recession Sallie Mae could charge me over $800 a month for all my loans.  Sallie Mae gives you one loan number but there are several sub numbers indicating several loans in which they mess with your payments to cause some of these to go into default when they shouldn't be.  I was also told yesterday by one of their customer service people that I should go find a better job and that the only thing I should be concerned about is paying them.  I have a family to provide for.  My co borrower and myself have both received threatning emails and letters from Sallie Mae.  It has now come to me calling my lawyer to seek legal actions against this company for threats, being told I should have not tried to advance myself through school if i could not pay for it.  Basically Sallie Mae is a monopoly owning several loan companies, debt collection agencies, and other companies so basically they make it impossible for you to pay things back and keep your credit straight.  If you are planning on going to school or continuing your education do not use Sallie Mae for loans cause they will in the end cause you to be in serious debt.  I have also thought about just filing bankruptcy to get them gone.  DO NOT USE SALLIE MAE THEY WILL SUCK THE LIFE OUT OF YOU!!Basically Sallie Mae has caused me to lose alot of sleep, I have stopped eating three meals a day to save money there and have gone to working 130 to 140 every two weeks so I can afford to live and pay them.  Lost time with my 7 week old daughter and my fiancee."
2008-08-29 19:18:22,"Reseda, CA",Russell,,"I received notification by mail that my Sallie Mae loan was past due and that I would be contacted by a collections agency. I immediately paid off all of my outstanding payments and now have an account in good standing, but not before Sallie Mae placed 5 negative credit items on my credit report from Experian. I have disputed all 5 claims twice, stating that I received no mail notification from Sallie Mae whatsoever until the last one which I reacted to immediately. They removed one negative report but left the other four. Sallie Mae claims that I had received notification prior to the final one by email, which I never received. It is my contention that Sallie Mae has not followed fair notification procedures. Had I known my loan payments were due I would have paid them promptly. Negative credit reports are for when you cannot pay your loan, not when you were not aware that the loan payments were due. Furthermore, if they removed one negative credit item they should have removed all five. I contacted Sallie Mae once more today to explain the situation and they told me I was out of luck. I would like to know who I need to contact now to raise this to the next level. As a consequence I now have four negative credit items on my credit history which I do not deserve. I want them removed."
2008-08-27 20:59:02,"Derby, KS",Nathan,,"I have been engrossed in an ongoing struggle with Sally Mae for several years now.  My student loan was originally through Emprise Bank who, unknown to me, sold my loan to Sally Mae.  Keeping in my that I was in School 3/4 to full time during all of this, Sally Mae then sold my loan to a collection agency While I was in the middle of a semester.  How did I find this out?    Not until I attempted to apply for the following semester's loans and was then sent a letter by the University telling me that I was no longer eligible to attend there do to my student loan being in default.  I contacted Sally Mae who told me that I needed to send them a deferment form and a letter of enrollment verification to them to place my loan back in good standing.  I had the University send them the enrollment verification, print me a copy of it and then I sent the deferment form to Sally Mae as requested. I never heard anything back from them.  When I then got a letter from FAFSA a couple of months later stating that I could not apply for my new loan as my current loan was in collections.  When I contacted sally Mae again concerning this, they informed me that they no longer had anything to do with my loan and that any further inquiries had to go through the collection agency.  I was in school at least half time this entire ordeal.  When I called the collection agency, they directed me back to Sally Mae.  On my second attempt, Sally Mae told me to send them a letter with all the information and they would review my case.  I did so, and included the enrollment verification form a second time.  They said they did nothing wrong and denied requalifying my account, leaving it with the collection agency who now wanted $500.00 a month on a loan that they never should have received.  Not only that, but my $8500 loan was now showing as 3 separate $4500 loans for a new total of $13,500.  I discovered that the collection company that Sally Mae sold my loan to was in essence another front as Sally Mae owns the collection company too.  So they in actuality sold my loan to themselves and almost doubled the amount owed, all while I was still attending school.  I did end up making a deal with this front to pay them a determined amount and after 9 months of good payments, my loan would be placed in good standing again.  After making my payments for 11 months, they sold my loan to another collection agency and the amount increased again to now roughly $15000.As a result of all this Highly Illegal activity on the part of Sally Mae, I have still been unable to finish my degree, causing me a decrease in potential salary that i have missed for the last 3 years.  Financially, they have placed a fairly significant black mark on my credit with the 3 loans showing in collections, and I was out all the money that I sent them for the nine months of their apparently false deal.  I am still struggling trying to complete school because of this and so far do not see an end in sight for this sham of a company's illegal operations."
2008-08-26 20:37:55,"Teanec, NJ",Jesus,,"Received a call from Sallie Mae about my student loan account on October of 2007. After speaking with Veronica she explained to me that she would place a forbearance on my account for 4 months and not to worry that it will not have any effect on my credit report.  On January I order my credit report and to my surprise there it was a 60 day past due negative reporting on my credit report from Sallie Mae.  Tried several attempts to discuss the situation with Sallie Mae customer service who transfer me to the Claims Aversion Dept who transfer me back to customer service. After about 45 minutes of phone tag, I finally got a supervisor who stated that it does not matter that I spoke with Veronica back in October as she did not place my account in forbearance as she indicated she would and that the delinquent account on my credit report still stand.  I feel that I should not be penalized for Sallie Mae's employees not doing their job or not being properly trained.A lower credit score and higher car payment due to Sallie Mae's incompetent employees."
2008-08-26 02:40:04,"Lynchburg, VA",Tamiko,,"I am writing in reference to a student loan that is being reported as defaulted on my credit report as well as the NSLDS, this has momentarily paused my ability to continue school. Also it has caused undue stress because I am be garnished for something that I currently do not owe. In August 1991 I took out student loans in order to go to Johnson C. Smith University.  Well, this started the beginning of my nightmare.   The first loan I took out was for a loan period of August 23, 1991 until May of 1992 in the amount of $2,498.00 after that another loan was taken out for August 1992 until May of 1993 in the amount of $2,439.00. My final loan during this school session was taken out August 1993 until May 1994 in the amount of $3,500.00 Only $1,750.00 of this was used since I did not return after Winter break 12/10/1993 (the day I left Johnson C. Smith).  These loans were disbursed into 5 different payments which total $6687.00  In 2000 I was notified that my loans were in default so I quickly contacted Direct Loans Consolidation to have my loans consolidated into one lump sum. Thinking this would help me reduce the amount I owe along with the stress of making sure three different loans were being paid.  In 2001 to my knowledge ALL of my loans were consolidated and I just owed William D F. (Direct loan Consolidation). By the end of 2001 I was again notified that my student loan was in default and I needed to pay or I would be garnished.  I called everyone trying to get information on this surprised loan that had appeared.  Well in the mist of getting the information I needed to dispute this, 25% of my payroll check with GE Financial was being garnished.  In July of 2002 I had to file bankruptcy (Chapter 13) due to the fact that I wasn't able to pay anything with this garnishment coming out therefore it was putting me into a bigger hole than expected. The interest was paid by my bankruptcy trustee to Sallie Mae. In 2007, I decided to return to school, but yet again I am faced with this demon called ""default."" I called Sallie Mae who was the guarantor of my loan to ask about this default. I received a letter from Kimberly D. with the Bankruptcy Litigation Unit at 1-800- ext 81196 dated August 29, 2007 stating that my loan was not in default. This served as my approval for Title IV financial aid at University of Phoenix. In February of 2008 my problems rose yet again, I received a letter from General Revenue Corporation about a defaulted loan they said they purchased from Sallie Mae.The first round of communication was rough, because the people at GRC was very rude, they threaten me telling me I need to pay them or else. Left harsh messages on my voice mail stating they know where I work and I better pay etc. I finally called back but never got a live person either a voice message or a busy signal.  I got tired of them calling all times of the day and night so I decided to leave them a message stating a number where I would rather be reached. They then called and harassed my mother as well as calling my job but calling to a location in a different city where I do not work. I received an email from one of the associates that stated that they had called and threatened that I pay them or else.  When I finally got a live person they transferred me about three times I finally talked with a guy named Joseph. He stated that they didn't care if I did have original paperwork they had to have them and not copies. I couldn't fax them to them nor could I mail copies. He stated that no matter what the account was in their office and I had to pay them or else.   He stated that they bought my loan in 2000 from Sallie Mae and they have had it since then but didn't contact me until this year. My second contact with GRC was about a week or so ago; I contacted them because of a garnishment they had placed upon my check for this student loan.  The stated this time that they bought the loan from Sallie Mae for 2008, well according to all of the information on NSLDS Sallie Mae is my guarantor not General Revenue Corporation. While reading the information on the check I was also reading a letter from USA funds/Sallie Mae stating ""What you OWE"".  Listed on this is a loan with the Department of Education for the amount of $9,640.00 which is my loans plus interest. This does not include the two other loans that I was able to get in 2007.   Now again I am struggling with this loan issue, I have a 15% garnishment from GRC for a loan that was consolidated in 2001 it looks like the paperwork wasn't completed at the Sallie Mae office but it was paid by William D F.  Now I have no one who is willing to listen to my case and explain to me what's going on I have no other choice but to contact, The Better Business Bureau, the Federal Trade Commission, the Attorney General's office and whomever else I can that will hear this issue. I want to finish school and show my kids that no matter how many obstacles come your way you can do whatever it is you desire in life.   I know God will take this letter and place it in the hands of someone who really wants to help.  Thank you for listening and helping me get over this hurdle."
2008-08-24 23:08:34,"Amherst, NY",Jessica,,"I have many loans with Sallie Mae. I have been in school at least half-time since Spring 2004. I had a six month grace period on my loans, and it isn't supposed to get used up until I drop below half-time status.  I received a letter from Sallie Mae dated August 8th of this year, stating that my loans were delinquent, despite the fact that I have not dropped below half-time status. The letter urged me to call Sallie Mae, and threatened to notify all credit bureaus that I was delinquent.I called and spoke to someone named Rebecca. She said she saw on her screen that I was in school full time and said that my loans were not in a delinquent status. She said she thought I got the letter because I didn't attend summer school. I said that didn't make sense because I've been in college for many years, have never attended summer school, and never got a letter like this. She shrugged it off.   A couple days later, I received an automated call from Sallie Mae addressing my delinquent loan status. When I pressed zero to be connected with someone at Sallie Mae, the call was dropped. I called back. I spoke with someone named Sarah. I explained to her that I received the letter and had called before, but was told everything was fine. Sarah said everything was not fine on her screen.   She checked in another screen and saw I was enrolled for the fall, but said that their records show I did not attend this past Spring (2008), which is incorrect. I did attend in the Spring.   I explained that I did attend half-time and gave her the name of the school. She said Sallie Mae was never notified by the school that I was enrolled there, and so my six month grace period was up. She granted me an in-school deferment over the phone, which had new terms.   For example, they can now increase the interest rate if they wish. They can charge me interest more often than quarterly if they wish. I have to renew the deferment every semester until I graduate, which will be a hassle. I had to agree to waive the terms of the original promissory note and agree to these new terms to have my loan deferred, which I shouldn't have had to do anyway, since I had been enrolled.  When I called the school to find out why I was not reported as enrolled, I was basically told that there was nothing they could do except fill out a deferment form, which has already been done over the phone. The woman I spoke with at the school did confirm over the phone that their records show I had been enrolled, but beyond that there was nothing she could tell me.  I called Sallie Mae back and spoke to a different person, who suggested I fill out forbearance papers. She said that the school will have to list all semesters I attended, and that will give Sallie Mae proof of my attendance. When I asked if that proof will get me my grace period back, she said that even once they have that proof, I will most likely not get my grace period back. She said she has never heard of someone getting it back.  Bottom line: I kept my end of the bargain, and because of an error beyond my control, Sallie Mae is taking away my six month grace period, and punishing me with additional interest charges and the inconvenience of having to renew my deferment each month. Sallie Mae will not grant me my grace period back, even with proof that I did attend.I will now have to pay more money in interest for these loans. My monthly payment is already going to be over $1000 a month. Yes, one thousand. Adding more in interest will just make it worse.  They call themselves Champions for higher education. Champions for their own pockets is more like it."
2008-08-24 06:08:05,"Lexington, KY",Debra,,"I came to this site looking for advice on how to deal with the great student loan god Sallie Mae.They can tell you all they want to that they are not harrassing you, but they are. Whenever someone calls you a dz. times a day to ask for infomation they already have , it is harrassment, pure and simple. The phone calls are not really my complaint. I am not home most of the time and when I am caller I.D. works just fine. Let me state up front that I do not have a student loan with Sallie Mae nor did I co-sign on one. My daughter however does. Biggest mistake she ever made.   I have been roaming the web sites about this Co. I find it hard to believe that they have been getting away with so much for so long and no one seems to be able to touch them.  I think the down with Sallie Mae movement needs to step it up a bit. That however is a discussion for another time. Prehaps after I state my complaint someone out there can direct me to a more essay type web site, where I can really voice my thoughts on the subject of student loans. Where there is so much more to this story I will try to stick to the comlpaint and make a long story short. The story: My daughter finished her spring semester in May 2005. Came home for the summer and began to prepare for a year of active duty in Iraq. She left the states on Oct. 15 2005. May to Oct. just about the six months period until she would need to start making payments on her loan. Before her boots hit the sand in Iraq, a letter was delivered to my home. The letter was to inform her that they had added just under 1,500. dollars to her student loan . They referred to it as a 'finders fee' because they had not been able to reach her on her cell phone or by e-mail. Her phone had been cut off before she left the states and her personnel lap-top had been left home as she was issed a computer by the army. (really does she need to hear from sallie mae in a war zone)  I had asked her before she left if she had contacted Sallie Mae to inform them she would be gone for at least a year. She said she had talked to someone by phone and it was no problem she would be on a military deferment. I don't know if she sent them an actual copy of her orders ,she had so many things to take care of before she left. Funny how easy it was for them to just pop that letter into an envelope and get it right to me.$1,500 must of been a hell of an expensive stamp. When I called about this, well of course they wouldn't talk to me about it. I should have her call. I tried to explaine to the nit wits that she couldn't call.  So I sent them a copy of her orders and a copy of my power of attorney by certified mail. They of course continued to call as we all know how Sallie Mae loves to use the finger,to dail the phone of course.  When I was sure the copies I had sent were delivered I tried once again to speak to someone about the problem but I was pretty much called a liar and I got nowhere. The last conversation we had with them was between my husband and them.They called ,he answered, not a pleasant conversation. However they must of received the info. they needed as they quit calling. We finally decided we were going to get no where with these people  and my daughter would just have to deal with it when she got home. After she got home I told her what had transpired. Needless to say she was not to happy about it.  She made many calls and became totally frustrated with the whole process. Trying to get an answer from some one she got the old run around ""no that didn't happen"", they don't know what she is talking about. I told her to keep calling until she got an answer. Finally she spoke to a ""manager"" who informed her it was not a finders fee but a one time charge for an insurance policy on her loan. By the time she got off the phone she was extremely irate.  She simply said to hell with them I am never going to speak to them again. If they are going to charge me for an insurance  policy they can just -- use it. Far as I know she hasn't  spoken to them even though they call her ,or did call her until she got so tired of it she had her phone shut off. Conclusion: She went back to school Jan.2007 and managed to finish her degree in Dec. 2007 without borrowing any more money from them or anyone else. She payed for it with the money she had saved while in Irag. She still owes the school a couple of thousand dollars and is paying as she can. They are not adding fees to it everyday as Sallie Mae would. However they have not sent her dipolma and probably will not until her bill is payed. Unfortunelly the beat of the last 7 years has taken its toll. She decided she needed a break to get her life back on track, before she looks for that ""career job"". It is a much deserved break and she will spend it catching up with herself and getting some physical therapy for her back and shoulder.  She knows she will have to deal with Master Sallie ,but says she will do it on her terms not theirs.  She has made several training films for the army and shot over 120 hrs of video while in Iraq. Personally I would like to see her do a documentary on the life of a Sallie Mae student.  If you have ideals on this subjects  I would love to hear it."
2008-08-21 23:54:33,"Phoenix, AZ",Heather,1.0,"I have multiple loans with Sallie Mae. There is one loan I have been having a problem with. I paid the amount shown online as well as what was given to me verbally to pay off a private student loan. When I paid the loan off I was sent an official notification.The letter states: Congradulations, this is your official notification that you have completely paid off your student loan. A couple months later they start calling me telling me I am over 60 days past due and owe late charges and interest on an outstanding balance. They harass me constantly at home and work. I never gave them my work# yet they call everyday at my work# when I keep telling them to stop.They say they have removed the # but I continue to receive calls. I have told them I will pay what I owe, it's not a problem but I want an explanation of where the extra money came from. I get many different answers, a different explanation everytime. One person even tried to blame my bank, that it took too long to post from my bank when the error was actually on their end. The funds cleared my bank just fine but Sallie Mae did not post my payment until about 3 months later. Noone gives me straight answers. I told them all I want is proof in writing showing where the extra money they say I owe came from because they say I underpaid the loan. They will not send it to me, I have asked for it over 5 times and instead they just send copies of my delinquent notices. I have repeatedly advised them I am willing to pay as long as they can show me why I owe this money. I don't believe they can provide me with what I am asking for and I am doomed to continue this vicious cycle. The longer I wait for them to send me what I'm asking for the more they show I owe. Even though the balance is unjustified I will have to pay to avoid going to collections. They constantly harass me and it affects my mental and physical health. It is very stressful to feel wronged and know I have been wronged and be left without any recourse. Also the constant calls at work put my job in jeapordy, as I am not authorized to receive calls there. I have already been asked to have my personal calls to work stop and they continue to call. It seems to me they ignore my many requests for the calls to my workplace to stop."
2008-08-21 16:21:55,"Brownstown, MI",Stephanie,,"I had an approved tuition answer loan that had the check lost in mailing. I called the school and Sallie Mae so many times I had to keep a running list. When the original check finally showed up it was pinned to a bulletin board in the hall. When calling Sallie Mae they told me the check was stale (of course) and they would not honor a new one because too much time lapsed. Well, I signed a contract and I did not cancel the loan so WHY can't they send a new check???? I sent back the stale one marked void as directed by them, and they said this was a sign that I wanted this cancelled, duh.  I need this money to finish my last year of school and have done nothing for weeks but argue with the customer advocate--Adelle. What a joke this department is they really need to label it the Sallie Mae advocate because she certainly didn't Have my interests in sight.Without this approved loan being replaced I can't finish the last year of school--so close to graduation for a bachelors degree in business, I have a family to take care of, a disabled sister and 2 young children, can anyone help me to get this loan replaced."

After six years she is only making $11.00 an hour.    Shortly after her graduation, I lost my job and had to start over with a new position at the bottom of the pay-scale.  I was granted forbearance.  Due to our debt level, I had to file bankruptcy, Chapter 7, two year ago.  I could not include Sallie Mae or the two mortgages.  I now owe $59,164.

I want the loan removed from all 3 credit reports. SMae, is unwillingly to do anything to remove paid debt.ruin my credit even more!!"
2008-08-12 23:00:03,"South Elgin, IL",Dawn,,"My husband has a student loan with sallie mae, we always pay within the 30 days it is due, but not on the exact due date. for example, it is due on the 25th, we usually pay anywhere from the 15th to the 20th before the next payment comes due. they call us seven days a week, about two times at home and once or twice on his cell phone. they wont talk to me, but they are very rude to me and one time they called and I told the woman the payment had been mailed out about three days ago and she said well thats just not good enough and hung up on me. My husband called them and told them to stop the harrassing phone calls. They said they will call until the payment is made and they have the right to do that. I researched about debt collection and printed a page from the ftc website that states a creditor may not use the telephone to harrass people and also that if the consumer sends a letter they have to stop calling. We sent the letter along with the attached paperwork from the ftc on July 31. On August 11 at 8:45 we recieved a recorded message from them. This morning, August 12, the phone call from them came in around 8:30. They asked for my husband, who was at work and said to tell him Sallie mae was trying to reach him. I asked him if he had gotten the letter that was sent to him and he said what letter? I informed him that he had sent a letter stating that he wanted the calls to stop and he said well until he starts paying his bills the calls wont stop. Now, he never asked me to identify myself, so he didnt know I was the wife. I could have been a babysitter, or family member and to make that kind of comment, I believe is a violation of my husbands financial privacy. I am appalled that they have the attitude that we are deadbeats when this payment is made every month. I could see getting these calls if we owed a payment when the next one came due. We are paying on the loan and they have no reason for this harrassment. Now they are in violation of federal law and after reading the website of complaints against this company, I believe someone should look into a class action law suit against this company. I think people are under the misconception that Sallie mae is a government agency so they are afraid. I think Sallie mae needs to understand that they are not above the laws but until someone takes action against them the harrassing calls will continue. I can tell you these calls are upsetting to my children, my son asked me if we were going to lose our house! I had to assure him that we pay our bills every month and no one was going to take our home away because of sallie mae. Its ridiculous what this company is putting people through and ruining credit on top of it.As I stated above, this is causing emotional stress on everyone in my family. My son has been upset many times by the calls and my husband has a high stress job and when they ring his cell phone it disrupts his work and is disturbing. I also resent having to feel that if I have company in my home, Im going to get one of these calls and it is embarrassing, especially when we are not delinquent on the loan."
2008-08-11 05:15:34,"St. Louis, MO",Lauren,,"I have been without a real job after college and trying to chip away at my student loans for the past year.  I just kind of have been making my monthly payments and not paying too much attention to my progress.  I always, however, pay more than the minimum.  I owe about 3,000 to AES, which was transferred from Sallie Mae.  Over the past year, my payments have been over $460, but my debt has gone down just $160.  Each month my interest goes up to ridiculous amounts - sometimes up to $44 when my minimum payments are set at $27.  It doesn't even make sense.  Often I see that my entire payment for the month goes toward interest, and notthing whatsoever goes toward my principal.  I am so angry and feel like there is no way to get out of this horrible scam."
2008-08-07 02:15:36,"San Francisco, CA",Janice,,"I just cancelled my application for a student loan for my son. After filing the paperwork and getting approval over a month ago, I called to check on the status. Each time we started from scratch: I was papers were missing, I refaxed them, waited 48 hours,called again and got the same story. It was like the Twilight Zone. I finally asked for a supervisor, told himI wanted to cancel, and he just said, OK. and that was it...three weeks of frustration and now I have to start over.My son's tuition is overdue and I have no funds to pay it."
2008-08-06 18:46:46,"Mchenry, IL",Jeff,,"6 months ago, I paid $150 to put my loans into forbearence.  I was currently experiencing economic hardship; I was working full time, but not making enough of my low-end middle-class income, to afford renting a room from somebody.  I was homeless; living out of my car for the cold winter, using whatever resoures I could tap for cheap food, laundry, and a shower.Today, on August 5th, I'm a little better off financially, however, poor credit, combined with no public assistance programs for the middle-class income, has still kept me homeless during the hot &amp; humid summer.I had planned to begin making payments early next year, and had called Sallie Mae to extend my forbearance another 6 months.The response that I got was that Sallie Mae is no longer offering forbearance options.  Even for excessive student loan debt (of which I have >$30,000 of) they wouldn't offer me forbearance.  I had to begin repayment. Their reason: Students have let their debt with Sallie Mae go by the wayside by constantly keeping it in forbearance, then, go into defaultI went to school to get an education, and to be worth more to company's who were looking for quality people.  I have suffered going to school homeless, and I'm suffering after graduation being homeless, and this bank, which offered assistance in paying for my education, and offered temporary financial relief in my difficult situation, now turns on me, interested in their bottom line, rather than the welfare of their customer. They're not going to gain much from suing a homeless man, (save for the rags on my back) so why not be patient with me and wait for me to get back on my feet! They're keeping me from recovering!"

2008-08-06 00:34:44,"Oklahoma City, OK",Leo,,After having taken out student loans with Sallie Mae I now owe more than I had originally borrowed for my education even after having made monthly payments on time and while paying extra each month on them.  I have tried to consolidate the loans down to a lesser interest rate but have had no luck with talking to their customer service reps present or past and who are nearly impossible to understand along with being extremely rude.  The toll free number to the consolidation department informed that they are not doing consolidations at this time and then disconnects the line and the web site is no better. It seems that Sallie Mae has been hijacked along with my hard earned money.During these hard economic times it is essential that one should be able to work with a creditor in securing more favorable terms of repayment especially when interest rates are so low.  My payment with them has been going up and I have struggled to pay extra each month yet the principal does not come down but in fact has increased.  There should be an immediate investigation into this institution.  Is it not a part of the Federal government or at the very least regulated by the Federal government?
2008-08-05 23:17:32,"Rochdale Village, NY",Shelly,,"I had a fire at my house about one year ago and was unemployed. I got a job and is trying to make payments on my bills since most of my information was lost in the fire.  My student loan went into default because I was not receiving my mails.  I called the student loan representative at Sallie Mae to make a payment arrangement but they refused to accept my minimium payment of $100.00 citing that they had already send my loan to collections.  I send a letter to the collection agency, GC Services, indicating that I am willing to make payments of $50.00 a month.  They are refusing to accept my offer. I called the GC Services and spoke with a representative who claimed that he was attempting to fill out a hardship information and proceeded to give him the debt I am paying.  Because I mentioned to him one of my bills was a overdue credit card, he felt that I should use my credit card to pay off my student loan.  I explained to the representative that I am trying to get off my debt and that my credit card has no credit available because of my previous unemployment status.  After some time the representative called Mr. F. who then stated that my $50.00 a month offer to pay off a debt of $3,000.00 is unacceptable.  I need help because to garnish wages of $300.00 a month is going to forced me to not be able to sustain myself.  I am at the moment struggling to maintain myself.  GC Services is treating to garnish wages from my salary for $300.00 a month. I am at the moment struggling to meet all my other bills. A garnishing of $300 would not allow me to meet my bills and sustain myself. If it is needed I can give you a breakdown of my bills and show you that I cannot afford to pay the amount that they are demanding. Please help!"
2008-08-05 16:03:51,"Philadelphia, PA",Meryna,,I have been attempting to pay the balance of my bill for 2 months.  When you call the 1888 number you reach a pay on the phone and it disconnects you.  When you attempt to reach a person the phone disconnects you.  I finally got in touch with someone today by gong thru another prompt and the person explained that there was a new number to call and the number on the website is wrong.  I talked with a supervisor and again he appologized and explained they have the incorrect number up and it hangs up on people.  This is insane.  I payed my loan off two years ago and was told I had a zero balance and a couple of months ago my uncle who co-signed started recieveing letters stating there was a 80 balance due.  This company is robbing people. My uncle did not think I was attempting to pay the bill. He's afraid this has credit score as well as mine.
2008-08-05 01:41:03,"Denison, TX",Christi,,"I submitted this information to the BBB so that you can see what has been going on concerning sallie mae.  This is my 2nd attempt to settle this. 1. The first disbursement (money paid to the college from Salie Mae) made on 10-09-2005 was made before I received the Truth in Lending Disclosure (dated 11/22/05).  In the BBB  response letter dated 07-30-2008 that I received in the mail today (08-04-2008), the Sallie Mae's Declining Balance Payment History report page shows first disbursement was on 11-21-05.  This is in discrepency with the Financial Aid Award Notification forms I originally received.  The other two dates are also in disagreement, but only by a few days. The first one is way off though. 2. The original Truth in Lending Disclosure form shows the three disbursement amounts correctly as three transactions totalling $4,873.00, however, the Sallie Mae's Declining Balance Payment History report shows three transactions, prior to loan repayment time, commented as ""supplemental fees"" totalling $292.38, yet the Truth in Lending Disclosure form shows these fees were prepaid.  My conclusion is Sallie Mae edited my records or something and took my money and pocketed it off the books, and of course added those fees to my balance, and even capitalized the interest on this amount as well. 3. When I first applied for the school loans, I only wanted subsidised loans, and was under the impression that the interest amount was subsidised and would not be capitalised to my loan while I was still enrolled in school.  The Truth in Lending Disclosure did not specifically say the interest was subsidised or unsubsidised.  Also, the interest rate I was originally told was WAY lower than the amount later disclosed to me on the Truth in Lending Disclosure form.  The form shows an outrageously high interest rate of 16.958%.  If I had known it was going to be that high and not subsidised, I would not have accepted the loan in the first place.  I could have got a better rate than that on a common credit card!  This is clearly abusive usury. 4. The Sallie Mae letter dated 07-25-2008 sent to the BBB and forwarded to me which as previously mentioned I received today (08-04-2008) states that the forbearance which was requested on 01-28-2008 was retroacted to 11-28-2008, however, even Sallie Mae's own records show my last payment was received by them and applied to my account on 11-19-2008.  Therefore, there was no need to retroact my forbearance all the way back to november since the next payment wasn't due until December, so at most the forbearance should have only been retroacted 1 month in stead of 2. Sallie May also did not inform me of this retroaced application, nor did they inform me that the forbearance would end sooner than I anticipated.  Had I been informed, I would have known it was going to end sooner than 6 months from the date I applied, and therefore would not have been assessed a late fee.  Salle Mae also did not inform me at the time that the forbearance period ended until after it ended, presumably so they could be sure they sneak in another late fee on me.  Again, this is very shady business practices. 5.  The Sallie Mae letter states the Truth in Lending Disclosure and a Declining Balance Payment History was included in their letter to the BBB.  I only received the Declining Balance Payment History (which is a misnomer, because the balance is doing anything BUT declining), but perhaps the BBB received the Truth in Lending Disclosure and did not forward that copy to me.  I would be interested in seeing the form they supposedly sent you to compare with my original Truth in Lending Disclosure to see if they falsified even more information. 6.  The Sallie Mae letter states that I signed a promissory note agreeing to pay the principal, valid interest, and fees associated with the account, but I actually never signed such a form.  I demand to see the actual form with my signature on it that shows the terms of the loan I supposedly agreed and signed. 7.  The Declining Balance Payment History also shows another transaction of ""capitalized interest"" on 05-16-2008 which was during the time I began disputing the validity of the charges and fees assessed against my account.  Financial institutions are required by law to not add fees to a credit account if it is at that time in a state of dispute. 8.  In recent e-mail communications with Sallie Mae's ""ETEAM"", refference ""Amanda"" at ext. 857, Amanda requested that I illegally send a post-dated check (30 days out) to pay for a month's payment after the forbearance ended plus the $50 ""forbearance fee"" to place the account again into forbearance.  If Sallie Mae's policy with forbearances is to retro act them to previous month(s) in order to nullify late charges and establish the account at ""current"" like they did with the first forbearance request, then why are they now requiring that a month's payment be made before placing the account in forbearance again, when instead they could retro act it like they did the first time?  Acction request: Since Sallie Mae uses unethical business practices, and I do not agree with the terms of the loan, then I demand that the loan be canceled and I will return the three disbursement amounts totalling $4,873.00, less the payments I've already made (not counting the $50 forbearance fee) totalling $399.88, leaving a grand total owed by me to Sallie Mae in the amount of $4,473.12.  Therefore, Sallie Mae's compensation or profit will in effect be the first $50 forbearance fee plus the prepaid supplemental fees of $292.38."
2008-08-05 00:32:10,"Thomson, GA",Lenore,,"I applied for an SallieMae student loan in 2006 with a co-signer.  When I filled out the SallieMae application for an student loan.  I chose to pay the interest while I'm in school.  It was ok, because I had extra money that was coming in my household (Child support).  My Child Support stop in October 2007.  This was a big hurt on my financial part.  I was trying to keep making my payment so that my account would not be delinquent.  About two months ago my financial was getting a little hard and I couldn't make the interest payments anymore.  I called SallieMae customer service to explain to them what was going on. I was told that I had to pay the $50.00 forbeadance fee (for 6mths).  After those 6 months. I would have to pay the interest again.  I was at work when one of the SallieMae rep called me and made me upset on my job about this account.  The rep name was Beth S. I explained to Beth about my situtation and that I could not make any payments right now.  Beth stated to me that my credit would be ruined because of this.  Just remind you this is just interest that I'm paying, not the loan itself.  She proceed to put me on hold while she talk to an Manager about this situtation.  I was on hold for about 45mins before she came back to the phone.  When she came back to the phone, she stated to me that she was going to email me some paperwork for me and my school to fill out stating that I'm still in SCHOOL. I checked my email and I did print out the papers that she emailed me.  She told me to fax that paperwork back to a certain number that she gave me.  She also proceed to let me know that she talked to an Manager and the manager stated that would be fine.  They would postpone the interest payment until I finish school.  I faxed the paperwork to my school (University of Phoenix) so that they can fax it back to SallieMae.  I have had an bad experience with SallieMae and I have other student loans with other companies and SallieMae is the worst company that I have ever dealt with.  They have POOR customer service for reps and Managers.  I had spoking to THREE managers today (8/4/08) about my account. I received an email today from a rep named (Jill J.).  I tried to call SallieMae to explain to them...that this should have been taking care of with Beth S. already.  I had one Manager on the phone name (Stacy ID#829)...she was very rude and asking me questions about my personal situation with the co-signer that I had on my paperwork.  When I stated to her that the co-signer couldn't may any payments (because he is laid off of work)...she proceed on LAUGHING and stated that he should have not co-sign if he couldn't help you make the payments.  I told her that was rude of her to say and that it was not any of her business to say that to me.  I stated that I want to talk to someone else, and she proceed to ask me why?  I told her that I was finish talking to her and she need to put another manager on the phone.  She put me on hold to find another manager. When that young man came to the phone...I ask him that Stacy explain to him about my situation.  He was very RUDE being a Manager.  I was trying to explain to him about what my situation was and he just kept on talking like he was ignoring my situation.  He stated to me that I signed an legally document and that I had to pay the interest no matter what.  I stated to him what would happen if a student is having financial hardship.  He just went on and on about that will not change anything and I signed an legally document stating that I would pay the interest on this account.  My problem with SallieMae customer service is that when you have a student that is trying to make a better life for themselve and you have RUDE customer service like this in the world.  How can we succeed if you are being treat badly.  The Manage was so rude that HE HUNG UP THE PHONE IN MY FACE! That is not good customer service.  My first instance was to report this type of customer service to the BBB (Better Business Bureau) of the way that SallieMae customer service is trying their customers and they are not trying to help them through this.  I have been upset from this encounter that I have indure today from SallieMae customer service and Managment. Managment should have not been rude to me. Something need to be done about this business."
2008-08-04 21:32:41,"Denison, TX",Christi,,I was in a forberance with sallie mae.  It started in January and I was told it would last 6 months.  When I went into my account in May I noticed a late fee and that payment was already due.  I was then informed that the forberance was retroactivated back to November.  Ok all that is in the past.  I needed to apply for another forberance as I am unemployed.  They told me pay what is owed for that month along with late fee and a forberamce fee that all this would need to be paid and that the forberance would go through.  I really do not have the money to pay the forberance fee on top of the other fees.  Sallie Mae refused this so I contacted the BBB and currently working that area now.  I was sent a declining balance payment history and the information on this is wrong.  Dates are wrong and comments do not match correct dates.At this moment economic would be the fact that it has been since may that this account has not be paid so the capitalized intrest is probably tripled.  I received phone calls and told them to contact me via email or USPS and I have recieved 1 correspondance since from them.  I have talked with an attorney that is building a case for other reasons against Sallie Mae and I have offered him my information.  If their firm decides to go towards my issues I will be contacted.
2008-08-01 13:01:35,"North Port, FL",Tom,,"Sallie Mae has referred my default $5500 loan (now totally $11k due to compounded interest) to an attorney.  I have received the ""carbon copy"" threat letter of lawsuit.  I am going forward with this and taking it to court!  I will not be bullied. There will be no economic or physical damage! I refuse to be bullied or threatened. If they want to file a complaint with my local Clerk of Court, then they're in for a ride!

2008-07-30 17:24:21,"Kenosha, WI",Scott,,"I took out a student loan with sallie mae in July of 2006 for some carrer training for Computer netowrking. The cost was $24,000, at the time of enrollment.  I had until 6 months after the class was done to make any payments towards the loan.  However during that six months I also had gone through a divorce which left me with a load of bills of my own from the marriage, plus the sallie mae loan.  When it came time to start payments on the account I was nearly making enough money to pay my rent, and keep food on the table for myself and my son.  So the loan went into default after about two months because of non-payment.  So, I called sallie mae and asked for a forbearance on the loan to get caught up on my bills.  They said they could if I made all the past due payments first.  I said all I can do is maybe two payments a month for two months. So they granted me a forbearance, but for only for four months, and normally they go for six months. So naturally here I am again unable to pay this loan because they will not extend the forbearance any longer and cannot refinance to bring down the payment amount.  The required payment amount did go down from $388.00 per month to $356.00, but it still isn't nearly enough so I can make ends meet.I had to take out several payday loans in order to pay for the past due amounts before they could put the loan into forbearance, and of course i am still paying on those payday loans becasue of high interest. Now sallie mae is threatening me with arbitrarion procedures. Thay have really drained my bank account to nearly nothing."
2008-07-30 02:16:20,"North Richland Hills, TX",Robert,,Out of $6000.00 dollars worth of payments they only applied $900.00 to my principal. I ask them to take the interest of and allow me to pay toward the principal but they refused. I have been paying on $13000.00 for the last eight years and I still owe the same amount.
2008-07-29 22:02:15,"Santa Monica, CA",Ramona,,"I graduated from a Tech school in December 2005. I have three private loans from Sallie Mae. Ive had several; forbearance on the private loans and have paid the processing fees to do so every six months. My account has been in overall good status since I graduated.    As of now Ive run out of the total allowed forbearance. My payments for the three private loans exceed $500.00 dollars a month and are unbearable. I have been trying to work something out with Sallie Mae since June of 2008 to consolidate my private loans because of now Im only paying interest payments, and not toward the actual debt I owe.  The representatives on the phone they either hang up on you transfer you back into the hold queue or give out wrong information one of them told me as of June Sallie Mae has put a freeze on consolidation without reason and he had no idea why and recommended I find a bank or someone to help me consolidate because Sallie Mae will not help anyone in the private loan repayment consolidation nightmare. Im contacting Dateline because this is a breach of contract in my humble opinion. When I was approved for these loans in my agreement it says Im able to consolidate, now that I want too Im being told I cant now. Two of my loans are 12% and the other is 15% interest only to make a grand total of $28,426.34. The consumers need help; I dont know what else to do at this point. My loans are in good standing and I have a late fee of $157.47 to catch up, however the underlying point is the actions are unjust that Sallie Mae has broken our contract agreement and I dont know who to reach out too! This is unfair and I hope dateline or consumer affairs will start an investigation on this matter. I know I have documentation stating I could consolidate the private loans, and this agreement has been modified by Sallie Mae and I had no knowledge of this until recently. This is totally unfair and could possibly make me lose everything I have except my apartment I rent.  Help!"
2008-07-26 02:13:48,"Madrid, NY",Kenneth,,"I went back to college at the age of 42 to 44 and thought it would expand the chances of getting a good job, not. I am making a very iow wage compared to the amount it took regarding the debt load for the education. My loans were est. $13,000 to $14,000, which is a minimal amount for a debt load. I am presently at 26,000.00 or more the intrest keeps adding up at such a rate per month that my $289.00 to $300.00 or more paid per month month does not ever reduce the amonut I owe. I don't even see credit card companies compounding on a daily basis. Sallie Mae has a system in place that asures that the youg person going to college to further thm selves will never get out of debt. I am not happy with this loan and do not see any means with my level of income to pay it down say nothing about off. I presntly work and just make ends meet regarding our family and bills just to keep are heads above water. If Sallie Mae wants to keep compounding this loan to tne point where I see no means of ever paying this off rather than working with the people well I may end up dead, I am going to be 51 and I am not getting any younger. I need them to work with me such as other places have worked with my Wife regarding her student loan, which is not a sallie mae and her loan is actually going down. My words along with others have to be heard and they need to help especially when the econemy is not the strongest. I would think it would be better to some payment than no payment. I need the interst taken off like some credit cards do when things are tough so your payment reflects a reduction on the princple atherwise your throwing your mony in the trash. I need help with this loan fast                            collection agency possible wages taken out of my check, which will only pay the interest and reduce money for my family and food and fuel."
2008-07-24 18:24:10,"Syracuse, NY",Kathryn,,"I have had many many problems with Sallie Mae. First of all, my mother discovered wrong numbers in the adding of interest to my account. Sallie Mae argued with her and refused to send her all the information on my account, and refused to explain to her how they got those numbers. My mother tried to get someone to help us with this and perhaps sue Sallie Mae for adding extra interest to my account, but we could not get anyone to help us. Sallie Mae has also repeated had problems with my school deferrment status while I attend medical school at SUNY Upstate. I have other undergraduate loans with citibank and have never encountered a problem. They have withdrawn over $1000 from my account even after I asked them to cancel the automatic debit. I have been charged with late fees, had my account put in deliquency, etc. I spend countless hours trying to take care of my accounts with them. I have tried to reconsolidate outside of Sallie Mae, but my interest would be much higher.They have put my account in deliquency, which has affected my credit score. I have had to pay extra late fees, on top of all the interest my loans are already accruing. I have had to deal with them many times through phone calls, emails, faxes to say the same thing over and over again. My mom is a cosigner and they have harassed her at work. I had my account on automatic debit before entering medical school and so in medical school while I was living off of loans, Sallie Mae withdrew over $1000 from my bank account, while I was still enrolled in school full time and should have been in deferrment. They could not give the money back to me. I had to a get a job and work part time while going to medical school in order to put food on the table."

How can i still owe on my loan when it has been paid off, i have my mom's set of papers &amp; my set of papers where the account numbers &amp; monies are exactly the same. The customer reps say they are two different loans one in my mom's name &amp; one in mine. I ask them to send me papers stating when and where the second loan came from. again, the same paper work that my mom has been paying on.  They are threating to garnish my husbands paychecks.This has kept us from getting morages and cars. Our interest rates our outragous. I am emotionally worn out trying to correct this. Our credit score is below 500 because of sallie mae. they have 9 reports on my credit."

At that time I was told that The Interest on this Single loan was to be around 8.7% Ive Since had to have the Loan Deferred 2 times and Now the Interest on this Loan from Sallie Mae isover 15% Which Means tha I am having to pay OVER $92,000 On a $32,000 Loan Which is Ridiculous By All, stretches of the imagination, And To Top it all I cannot seem to find an Employer That is Willing to Pay more than Minimum to $10 Hr for My Degree!! And Im Supposed to Pay $530 a Month on this Single Loan, As A single Mother Making $10 an Hours The Math Speaks for itself Just Got Bent Over By The Fine Crew At Sallie Mae! I wpuld Like to Know How A company can Just Play with Interest rates as Sallie Mae Does and They Will not Even Attempt to work With me on this, What Can I do as A single PArent With a minicule income to get Sallie MAe Off My Back&gt;??"
2008-07-14 12:10:25,"Schenectady, NY",Mary,,"Laid off from telecom company bought by Worldcom in summer of 2001. Due to volatile nature of business, and employment research, enrolled in DBA Admin course at local tech school. Financing was offered by Sallie Mae at school's recommendation. Completed class in September of 2001. Began making $100 to $150 payments to Sallie Mae within a couple of months.  Started out owing approximately $11,000 and it is now 7 years later and I owe more than I did at the start of the loan.  I was given deferral payments for approximately 10 - 12 months over this period due to loss of employment over this time.  I was never able to get any kind of job in the field I was trained for so went back into telecom, which is still highly unstable.This has impacted my credit report in an adverse way because of the delinquencies.  The bigger issue is the constant harassment about payments due.  I received 9 calls looking for payment in a 3 day period, including Sunday mornings and holidays.  I have been making payments, if not always on time or the minimum they are looking for.  At first I attempted to advise them of my situation but it was impossible to get someone who would take the information or offer any assistance, if I could even get to someone in Customer Service.  I have also made 3 separate requests for an itemized accounting of all payments and debits on this account since the inception of the loan and have received nothing to date. I would like to know how it is possible to owe more, after 7 years of payments, than you did initially and no one can give you documentation as to why!  Thank you"
2008-07-11 15:52:49,"Omaha, NE",Jessica,,"5 years ago I began repayment on my $103K Sallie Mae student loan debt. I was on a commission based salary at the time and paid a double payment in one month and then didn't pay the following month. Anywhere else, this would be perfectly fine and there would be no issue. However, with SM, I received a late notice and was told I lost my right to a lower APR by making the first 24 months payments on time. I fought and fought to have them see that I didn't miss any payments, but instead actually paid them EARLY. To no avail, they did not grant my wish. This exact thing happened to my brother, as well. Since then I have made nearly $600 payments every month for 5 years, totaling around $36,000. YET, I've only had a $10,000 lowering of the overall debt. I believe that SM scams, not some, but MOST of their people. I have spoken with numerous people who are doing anything and everything to break free of the company that seems to never be quite honest or upfront about their business. As I've read about others, I didn't initially start all of my loans with the company due to things I'd heard prior. However, without my consent, SM acquired ALL of them.  If anyone has advice about a gov't site, I would be interested in reading a post where we could make our issues heard there. Due to this issue, I lost out on any reduction in the APR. They are not willing to consolidate my loans at this time, either. Not only that, but I am not seeing how I haven't made more headway in the overall amount after paying so much in the last 5 years."
2008-07-10 02:02:50,"Ontario, CA",Wanda,,First the school UTI forges my name to over charge me. I have all documents needed to prove it. I have wrote several letter and I sware I went into the Rancho Cucamonga location and spoke to a gentleman that said I was correct but he could not do nothing to help me. All I get is lies from this school.  Starting with Bruce P. all the way up to Roger S. who is the V.P. Than Sallie Mae (who we are forced to use) Has a never ending finance charges that I had to take a second on my home to pay. Please contact me I have so much more to show and tell. I have been battling with this for years. I'm currently suffering from a skin disorder from my nerves.
2008-07-10 00:00:39,"Franklin, MA",Marie,,"I have been paying on my two kids student loans which are in my husband's name (not parent loans) since September 2004.  Even though I have paid these loans on time every month, and usually pay more than is expected, I am harrassed by this company on a monthly basis. Two examples that stand out to me:  Last summer (2007) I was getting calls morning, noon and night day after day. I have been at the same address and phone number for 15 years, and I never ignored one of their calls.  (and I was never truly delinquent)  I sent them so much money to try to get these supposed delinquent loans up to day, but they kept crediting the money to the wrong accounts. Even though I was paying all this money, since they weren't crediting the accounts properly, they sent my loans to a collection agency.  That collection agency called my in laws and told them we were delinquent.  Told my inlaws how much money we owed in student loans, for which kids they were and to which schools my kids attended. (my inlaws know what schools their grandchildren attend, but the principal of the matter is that they gave out personal information).  Sallie Mae continue to harrass the grandparents and also called everyone in my town who has the same last name as me, even though we were paying these loans on time every month. Finally I sent a certified letter to Sallie Mae with yet another check asking them to credit the money properly and for a bit the phone calls stopped.  They told me to go online and start paying, which I did.  That didn't work because they still do not credit the money to the loans properly, they just credit whatever loans they feel like the day they receive the money.  Finally, someone told me to stop paying online and start sending in checks with a note.  (by the way, I do not receive a bill which I have requested.  I've also requested a coupon book which I cannot have either.)  So, I go online every money and see what extra charges have accumulated since my last payment (usually with delinquency even though it was up to date as of the month before) and I end up sending about 5 checks in one envelope with a sticky note attached to each one explaining specifially what to do with that particular check.  I also write a separate letter stating the same thing in case the sticky note gets lost.  It never works.  For example, my June 21, 2008 payment was made on June 3, 2008.  My loan was up to day and not due until July 21, 2008.  On the 4th of July, 2008, at 8:00am, I started receiving calls stating that this loan was once again $19.52 past due and it was already 41 days delinquent.  I asked how that could be because I check these loans obsessively because I don't trust this company, and on July 3, 2008 they were up to day.  So in one day we went from being up to day, to 41 days delinquent.  I told them that I overpaid the June payment and that they misappropriated the money and the bill collector started yelling at me and telling me it was my fault the loans were delinquent because I send way too many checks and too much money.  (payments total $572.67 and I usually end up sending between $600 and $700 lately to try to keep ahead but it doesn't work)  She told me to send one check for the $572.67.  I told her that in the mail they should already have the July payment which was also 5 checks and that there was more than enough money in the mail to cover the delinquency.  They expected me to pay the $19.52 over the phone and had the nerve to tell me that they would charge me a fee of $10.00 to make that payment. I refused to do it, I figured they'd get the money on the next business day.  They continued to call me on the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th of July. (last night). Today I checked the account and it says that as of July 3rd, the payment was made and it is now due for the August 21, 2008 payment.  Of course, they did not credit the loans properly like I asked them to do in the notes I sent.  (they credit my still in school daughter's money to my in repayment daughter's loans, even though I asked them to put the money to the in school loans so that I can pay down the principal and accrued interest)  I believe that Sallie Mae is a fraudulent company that collects so many extra interest payments because I believe they intentionally misappropriate the money.  I keep getting interest accrued on one of my daughter's in school status loans which is up to $1500 in interest alone and I sent them the money to pay it down and they continually put the money on the loans for the girl in repayment even though I send them plenty of money to cover her payments too.  They ruin credit and they have no interest in helping resolves issues. They intentionally create so much stress in the lives of people who are honest and law abiding by making us feel like criminals. They purposely ignore certified letters and email correspondence. They make themselves difficult to get hold of if you just have a simple questions and last but not least, they are the rudest people to deal with."
2008-07-06 00:33:30,"Germantown, MD",Stacy,,I check my Sallie Mae account on-line nearly every day after reading horror story after horror story. I've never had a problem until this month.  I keep getting a You are X days delinquent when I have proof that they cashed my payment.   I sent an email but no response yet. I'm afraid I'll wind up like the horror stories I hear.
2008-07-04 17:31:05,"Plattsburgh, NY",Corey,,"It's hard to think about what is the right thing and what is the wrong thing to do.  I feel like I've always tried to do the right thing for myself and those around me.  Why, then, does it feel like everything I've accomplished in recent years is a mistake? In 2002, I did what most high-school graduates do: I applied for college.  I was accepted into the State University of New York at Plattsburgh, which meant relocating from Tampa, Florida to Plattsburgh, New York.  I suppose this was my first error in judgment. Going to college is great, no doubt about it.  I chose to go to a school out of state (way out of state), though, which meant a greater cost of tuition.  Not only that, but my financially not well-off parents apparently made too much of a combined income for me to be offered any sort of support to help pay for college. Immediately, I was thrust into the world of student loans.  My parents and my brother did their best to help me out when I first started my college career, but soon enough I had built my own positive credit and was able to acquire loans in my own name. That sure felt nice.  I was financially independent from my parents.  I was learning and growing on my own.  I was becoming, or was preparing to become, a functioning, important part of society. And then I graduated. That's supposed to be a time for great joy, right?  Celebrations and parties.  Pats on the back and hand shakes from those who have taught you for the past four years.  A first step into the real world where you could find a good job.  A job that would put everything you've studied for the previous four years to work.  A job that would help you sustain an adult life. Now, I realize that you're not guaranteed a firm landing feet-first as soon as you receive a diploma.  I didn't expect, though, that it would take two years for me to find a job that applied even a hint of what I had studied each day. So, there I was.  Finally.  A job that I enjoyed in a field that was related to my degree.  Things were looking up, right? Wrong. Because I still didn't make enough money to cover the costs of my growing student loans.  The main problem?  Loans through Sallie Mae.  A company, who I've found, through research online and from word-of-mouth, is one of the most customer unfriendly loan-servicing companies around.  A quick Google search of ""Sallie Mae Complaint"" will bestow upon you a bevy of sites chock full of people voicing their displeasure with this company. I could be one of them.  I should be one of them.  Each month, Sallie Mae expects me to pay them in excess of $400.  That comes out to be a third of my paycheck each week.  That doesn't sound so bad, until you factor in some other things.  Things like rent, groceries, bills. oh, and let's not forget--my other student loans. I spoke with Sallie Mae.  I tried to tell them that there was no possible way that I could afford that payment each month.  I tried to tell them that I just didn't make enough money to make ends meet.  I tried to work with them to lower my payments.  I tried.  They didn't.  Every response was a canned response.  Every solution came from a playbook intended to drive my debt up even further while I flounder. I've met with a student loan advisor whose advice to me was: ""You need to have more money.  Or marry someone who does."" Solid advice. I sought out additional employment, and I've finally come across it.  Now I work two jobs--one full-time, one part-time.  From 9 to 5, I have a day job where my degree is put to use.  From 5 to 9, 10, or 11 PM, I wash dishes.  Is this it now?  Are fourteen hour work days the American Dream? It might be, but I wasn't done there.  I've now got a third job!  A design job on a project-by-project basis.  24 years-old with three jobs, and I'm still not sure if I'll be able to fully support myself. Maybe that's it?  The unending stress and helplessness that comes with being a college graduate?  Is that the American Dream? I know that I'm not alone.  I know that I'm not the only person who is affected by a loan company keeping them from experience a life that is free of doubt and sadness.  I know that I'm not the only person trying to work with a company to set some sort of realistic payment plan to work on paying off a debt. I know that I'm not alone.  But maybe nobody else knows that.  Maybe other people in my shoes don't know that there are others just like them.  Maybe the people who would fight for us don't know that there are enough of us out there who are struggling.  Maybe the people who are holding us down need to know that there is a better way.  Maybe the people who outrank them need to see that there is something happening that just isn't right. I'm not looking for an easy out.  I'm not looking for a way to get out of paying my loans back.  I'm just looking for a way to pay my loans back.  On time.  At a rate that I can afford without having to decide if I'd rather not buy groceries this week or not pay a bill. I thought I had it all figured out.  High-school.  College.  Graduation.  Job.  I took all of the right steps.  I did all of the right things.  Still, I win and lose.  I succeed and fail.  I take one step forward and one step back.  All at once.  Every day.  I am going nowhere with these problems looming over my head. If this is how it is supposed to be--if this is the American Dream, then I hope that I wake up to a better reality."
2008-07-02 20:17:04,"Hawthorne, CA",Shavontae,,"I was granted a loan through Sallie Mae Inc in March of 2005. I attended Maric College in Carson,Ca. Upon completion of the Medical Assisting program I was informed by Maric College that I would have to start payments for the loan in May of 2006. But everytime I called Sallie Mae to inquire about my loan, I was told by several representatives that I didn't exist in their computer base. I called for a loan consolidation in October of 2006 and was given the same information, I didn't exist. This issue has resulted in Sallie Mae defaulting my loan.  I am continuously denied employment because the loans appear to be past due on my credit report. I am unable to futher my education because I'm not eligible for financial aid. I am unable to apply for credit. I have also been denied by certain appartment homes, while trying to find a place to reside."
2008-07-02 17:49:30,"Moreno Valley, CA",James,,"I have had prety much all the same problems with Sallie mae reps that I have read about. Never before have I encountered such a group of unhelpful, rude, lieing, backstabbing bunch of people in my life. I can not believe how this company treats is customers. I even asked for a corp. number to speak to someone that could help me with my situation and they flat out refused teling me that there is no one else that I can deal with other then there crappy dept. I did not accept this anwser and found the corp. number and was connected to the advocate dept. where the lady was helpful and able to do for me what I orignaly wanted to do."
2008-06-30 21:23:43,"Broken Bow, OK",Sandra,,"I have been trying since Friday, June 27, 2008 to log onto my Sallie Mae on-line account and pay my bill.  When I try to long on, I receive an error message that says We're unable to locate an account for you at this time.  Please verify your information or call.  After several more attempts to log on, I called Customer Service.  The gentleman I spoke with verified my account information and said he would send me a temporary password by email.  He verified my email address.  I never received the email.  I checked my junk mail box and my server's spam filter and found nothing from SallieMae.  The next day (Saturday) I changed my password online.  When I tried to log in I received the same error message.  I tried using my old password and received the message that my password and user ID didn't match the information they had for my account.  So on the one hand, they have account information for me, but on the other they are unable to locate the information.  I tried calling again and received a recording that said they were having phone troubles.  I tried a few more times, receiving the same recording.  I tried to log in again on Sunday, June 29 and received the same error message as on June 27.  I tried calling and received a recording that stated the number had been changed.  The new number was exactly the same as the old number.  The phone rang twice, then a recording said they couldn't take my call and to call back in an hour.  When I did, I got a busy signal.  On this same day I received a do not reply to email from Sallie Mae stating that my bill was now available on-line. By this time, my payment is late.  It would have been on time if I'd been able to log in on June 27. I sent a fax asking someone to call me.  I have received no response.  Today, Monday June 30, I tried again to log in and received the same error message.  I tried to call and received the message that the number had been changed and, again, the new number was the same as the old.  I was told to call back in an hour.  Again, the line was busy.  FINALLY, at about 3:00 pm CDT I was able to get through to SallieMae's automated phone system.  I had to schedule a call-back because of the high volume of calls.  It is scheduled for Wednesday, July 2 at 1:00 pm.  I have little hope that they will actually call.    One of the selections on the automated phone system was to go ahead and pay my bill and bring it up to date.  Instead of allowing me to pay what was due on June 28, they now want two payments plus late fees - even though the July payment isn't due until July 28.  My payments are over $700/month.  I can't afford to pay them $1400.The amount of the late fees were not itemized.  I suspect they are levied against the entire loan and tacked on to the end of the loan.  I currently owe $95,000+ to them.  I had some financial difficulties several years ago and had to declare bankruptcy.  It was a Chapter 13 bankruptcy.  I could not write off the student loan, but it was put into forbearance by the court until the agreed upon payments were completed.  At the end of those 5 long years, SallieMae tacked on $30,000 in Capitalized interest to the $65,000 original debt.    My husband and I are retired.  We are able to make the payment every month, but it is usally payed very close to the due date because I have to wait until his Social Security check is deposited into his account.  I've noticed that even when I pay the bill on time, it often takes SallieMae a few days to post it, which makes the payment late. All I want to do is log on to my account and pay my June bill.  SallieMae is preventing me from doing that.  They did not send me the temporary password so I could access my account.  Now my payment is late and they've added late fees.  I can't get through their phone system to communicate with them.  What is my recourse?  I want to take care of this as soon as possible before I start receiving harrassing phone calls."
2008-06-29 23:08:34,"Pomona, CA",Gerardo,,About a year ago I took out a school loan that was through Salle Mae and it went Directly to Silver State Helicopters. The loan was a Secondary Loan that was never used. A year later Silver State Helicopters Files for Bankruptcy. Sallie mae still make me responsible for a loan that was never used and was suppose to be returned. I made payments on it in case I used it. But with all the leagal fees of hiring a lawyer for what happen to silver state I fell behing Sallie Mae. They would not except partial payments or work with me. My loan is about to default a loan that was stolen by Silver State Helicopters. I called sallie mae for a help once again and everytime I call they refuse to help me and they get verbaly abusive. They threat me with placcing a refusal to pay. sallie mae always threat me with taking me to court and that I will have to pay back the loan with 125% intrest. They are an eduction leander. The money was never spent it was suppose to be returned if not used. I have tried to work with them but everytime I call It gets worst!

2008-06-26 23:49:00,"Westfield, NJ",Heidi,,"For the last few months, I have received phone calls from Sallie Mae representatives saying that I am late in my student loan payments.  I was late, so I arranged to pay the arresrs to catch up.  For my final payment in May 2008, I was told that my account was current. Within a couple of weeks I received a call from a representative saying I was over 60 days late.  I told him that it was impossible since the payment was due that day.  He told me that I was in arrears from 2007----when I went online I see that the larger payments were not applied toward the arrears----the larger amount was applied to the principal.  I then paid the amount that supposedly was due in May---thinking that my account would be up to date.  The next day, I received a call from a Sallie Mae rep. who stated that my account was 90 days late.  I told her that it was impossible and went through the history.  She told me that the payment takes 2 days to reflect and that the 90 days included July's payment.  She agreed that with the payment I would have been 1 day late on June's payment.  I spoke with her supervisor who said that the system would be updated and my name would be cleared from the data base.  Today, I received a call again saying that I was over 62 days late and in collection.  I told the rep. that my bank account reflected payment was received by Sallie Mae.  He also agreed that the system was reflecting a late payment for July 2008---payment date is July 24, 2008.  I told him that I am highly suspicious of Sallie Mae---especially after reading all of the complaints, it seems that Sallie Mae is attempting to cause defaults to receive a pay out from the gov't.  He told me that my name will be cleared from data base."

When they call and I tell them that I paid they call me a liar. They extremely rude and nasty. They also refuse to send my my new payment book that I should have had months ago. they said i signed up for electronic payment and i never did. I never do that with anyone.

2008-06-20 02:55:04,"Baton Rouge, LA",Louvenia,,"I have been having trouble with all kinds of people calling my house from  sallie mae. They call every day morning til night all during the day. They call from all kinds of numbers from different states, one hundred numbers and straight long distance numbers as well. They first use to call for my son who had a loan from them for school. That was a everyday call night and day and all through the day. Even though I would tell them he was not here they would question you as to where he was when will he be back did he have another number to be reached at and so on until I just hang up. They would call right back about few minutes later. Sometimes longer but they were sure to call back. My son finally got a loan to consolidate the loan with them, but the calls never stopped coming. Several months ago they started calling my house for someone who gave my son's name as a reference sometime back. I have told them over and over that he did not nor did he ever lived here but they just want stop calling for him. They first lied and said my son had co-signed I called the so called office of Sallie Mae direct and spoke to someone who said he was manager and he asked me for my phone number and pretend to looked it up and said that the phone calls was a mistake and he was sure to remove my phone number and he promised me that I would recieve no more calls. About an hour or two later I recieved non other then a call from sallie mae asking for the same gentlemen that I have told them over and over again that he do not live here. I waited a couple of days before calling the company back and got another man who suppose to have been a manager also, after I explained the situation to him and that I had called days ago and that I was told that the calls would stop and they hadn't his reply was that he apologize but they should have told me that it would take 72 hrs. for the number to be removed and the phone calls to stop. He assured me that after 72 hrs. I would not recieve no more calls. He must have meant 72 months because they calls never ceased. They calls and sometimes just hang up when I answer they talk smart on the phone and gets me so upset. When I tell them to stop call my house they thinks it a joke and start questioning me. Some say things like I will remove the number right now and hrs. later they call right back. I have contacted my phone company and also use call trace. I am so tired and drained with the harrasing phone calls sometime I just have to go and sit down to catch my breath because I be so upset, I have highblood pressure and I'm sure that's not good for me to get so upset. I put up with them calling my house for my son like they where crazy but I should not have to endure the harrasament for somone else who is no kin of mine and does not live here. How can a company get away with such poor customer service. I sometimes just don't even answer the phone. Is there a solution to this problem?"
2008-06-19 19:26:24,"Huber Heights, OH",Jill,,"The customer service representatives are very tough, if not impossible to understand.  I'm trying to get my payments lowered so I can get out of forebearance and can get almost nothing done.  In the mean time I rack up late fees, and who knows what else and each time I call I have to get the canned message about how I owe $600, 900, 1200!  I called them about this and they said no, I was up to date as of last month (as it should be) and the next minute said I owe $900.  HUH?  And all of this while I'm saying I cannot understand you, please speak slowly, clearly and loudly and asking them to repeat every other phrase.  Forms don't get sent to me, we go round and round and get nowhere. This is ridiculous, something has to be done."

Since they did not give me a good interest rate when I tried to reconslidate I took my business to Citibank.  (Sallie Mae thought I had poor credit, my credit score is 720 and I just bought a small studio so I don't know where they got that information.)Prior to the payment being sent from Citibank, I emailed Sallie Mae giving them detailed directions to which loans to apply the payment to.  I also called a few days prior to the check getting there to make sure a note was placed on my account that loan 11 should be paid off in full.  I have had many issues with Sallie Mae so I thought I would take all precautions.  Of course they applied my payments how they saw fit, paying down a little for each loan, even the federal loans with low interest rates.  I called to clear everything up, after hanging up the payments were still misapplied.  So I called again a few days later when I noticed the mistake.  This time the payments were all applied correctly and I even saw the updates immediately online.  The account I wanted paid off was at $0. Later on that month I checked to make sure my payments had gone down for the month, that's when I noticed that once again my payments had been moved around and the loan that had been paid in full once again had a balance.  And once again my federal loans had been paid down. I really feel like Sallie Mae is doing everything in their power to make a buck from me.  Maybe if I'm slow enough, I won't catch the mistake and keep paying my life off in interest.  Their interest rates are insane, the calls are routed to India and I can barely understand the person's name that I'm speaking with and they almost never have a solution to any of my questions.  Please avoid this company at all costs.  I have had much better experiences with Citibank, KEy Bank, and NJClass loans."

I said that the request violated everything we are told not to do for security.He then told me I was seriously past due and would not listen to me when I said I was not.

2008-06-14 19:57:32,"Avondale, AZ",Joel,,"Sallie Mae has become confused about my forbearance status.  I have a hard copy letter from them stating I am in forebearance until May 5, 2008, yet they claim that I am delinquent in paying April's bill which I do not owe due to the forebearance.  Since May they have  continually harrassed us by calling every 40-60 minutes using two different numbers.  They have called friends of ours to harrass them about our delinquency.  We have attempted to explain the mixup and they have not changed their behavior.  Yesterday they called and without using any profanity, I emphatically asked/told them to stop this harrassment which caused them to hang up on me.  Later, when my wife called they hung up on her, telling her she was being abusive, which she certainly was not.  Supposedly, I was transferred to a supervisor today by the name of Anthony employee (who hung up on me earlier today).  Anthony verified that his records showed that we had become upset with them on the phone.  Evidently part of their policy is to harrass you until you get upset, then not communicate with you to resolve the issue, but continue the harrassing phone calls.We will resolve to never use this company again, and to advise everyone we know to stear clear of it.  We would also like to pursue legal action against this company for predatory behavior and harrassment.  This company should be made a public example."

Sallie Mae calls every day and is rude.  Further, every time they call, they tell me something different.  For instance, a few weeks ago they told me that I could get a forebearance if I paid them $150.  So, I scrounged the money in an effort to save my credit and called in to pay it.  Once on the phone, the person who answered passed me to a manager who yelled and screamed at me.  He told me that I could not have a forebearance until I pay all of the past due amount.  He then accused me of lying about trying to find a job and proceeded to lecture me about moving WITHOUT SALLIE MAE'S PERMISSION!!!!  These calls are very upsetting and difficult.  I am afraid to answer my phone anymore because I don't want to be screamed at by some Sallie Mae employee.  These phone calls on top of my difficulties in finding work keep me up at night and make me angry and upset.  It also affects my mood and my relationship with my husband."

2008-06-11 12:10:47,"West Lafayette, IN",Maureen,,"As usual, we have been paying on this loan for 4 years ($17,000) and only $2000 has gone to the principal.  Most recently, we have paid before the due date and of the $125 payment, $98 goes to interest!  I don't understand how you can pay before the due date and the earlier you pay, the more it goes to interest.  You can never speak to someone in this country, UNLESS you press the I want to defer payment button, then they are there for you.  At the rate we are going, this loan will take years to pay off and our son would like to go to culinary school and I don't see how he can afford to get another loan.  Financially, this is the one bill I do not see a light at the end of the tunnel.  It's not right when you pay $200/month and only a fraction goes to the principal and that amount changes every month."
2008-06-10 19:13:17,"Covington, LA",Daniel,,"I originated a loan in 2003 to attend Kennedy Western University online. Who at the time I thought was an accredited university but I came to find out they were not. But anyway, I borrowed $10,200.00 at 10%. No payments for 16 months while I was in the program. Great, All was well. but, then I began to experience back pain again and was diagnosed with another ruptured disk and I required major fusion surgery to fix my back. This went on untilt he surgery finally took place in December of 2004. After recuperation I spoke to Kennedy Western and tried to get the money refunded since I had been and would be unable to participate in the program. No luck there. So I began paying on a loan I was never able to use. Kennedy Western got their money, I got nothing. But anyway, I digress again. I'm furious with Kennedy western also, but that' another story to the story. I began making the payments, and then faced a few financial disasters and had to take a forebearance to clear up my deliquincies and get me back on track. That fixed the problem and I thought all was well. Then in 2007 it happened again, I had to take another forebearance to get out of financial difficulties with them. But, after both of these forebearances which we thought was a good thing to help us, I received a statement saying I now owe $11,600 ""Principle"" on my loan of $10,200.00. I have yet to have anyone tell me why this is or be willing to explain how I can owe an additional $1400.00 on my loan. We have been paying for almost 4 years and now owe $1400.00 more than I borrowed. I have been hung up on several times when I ask for an explanation. I can only conclude that Sallie Mae is a dishonest company and gets away with fraudulent loan practices. I need help. Sallie Mae won't help, so who can?"

I deferred my student loans with Sallie Mae for 12 months.  I was not notified that my payments had started.  I contacted Sallie Mae and worked out an agreement to consolidate my loans and they would remove the adverse accounts from my credit reports after 6 months of good standing of the consolidated loans.  I wrote Sallie Mae requesting them to honor there agreement was told that they could not remove the adverse reporting.  So the end result is that I the loans being reported in both good standing and adverse.  I have tried to get the account move to another lender and no one will touch Sallie Mae loans.  Trying to go to school to better your self and needing loans, my recommendation don't not borrow from Sallie Mae, they are very difficult to work with.This has put my credit rating in the toilet and I cannot even get credit to buy furniture, and other high dollar ticket items that need to be purchased."

Even though we did move in 03 I still had all my mail forwarded and salliemae did not ever send me anything. So we lost 2 days work and had to shell out $500. I have hired an attorney for chapter 7. Now I get a summons for court and they are planning to garnish my and my husbands wages. They now say they hold one loan not eligible for consolidation but will not say why.2 days lost wages in Sept 07, $500 and mental stress due to impending garnishment, this would put a financial strain on us. $1300 to lawyer for chapter 7.

No compassion what so ever, no understanding, all they want is their money, not caring that the man was on his death bed at one point.  It is horrible how they treat ALL the people who intrusted them.  Just tack on late charges, interest payments and make harrassing phone calls.  I urge everyone to contact them in one form or another letting them know about this site.  I would love nothing more than to send this to them.  We got a $2,000.00 loan and you would think we owed them a million dollars.  NO ONE should ever take a loan from them and everyone should encourage their friends and family to stay away from Sallie Mae. The harrassing phone calls did not help my fiancee's health at all..They are heartless and could care less that he is in intensive care.  Yes, we are behind, but with the economy the way it is, my fiancee on total disability and only receiving SSI, he is in no condition to be harrassed when he does come home rom the hospital.."
2008-05-14 21:19:52,"Santa Ana, CA",Alan,,"I had borrowed only one student loan with Sallie Mae. I paid off the loan 2 year ago. Before Sallie Mae have the direct deposit feature, i used to write lum sum check to Sallie Mae 10 months/check so i don't have to keep track of it every month. One time i wrote a 3 month lum sum check, Sallie Mae disregard my options and make it only months. ( this is 9 years ago). Last month, i was trying to get a mortgate loan, my credit report popped up 2 degratory Sallie Mae account and 4 good Sallie Mae account. The degratory account have 90 days late with note ( account transfered). 4 good accounts are not over until 2017. I called Sallie Mae 3 times but all of the people i talked to, decline to help. They told me that i need to dispute to the bureau credit. I paid 39.99$ through Experian but Sallie Mae declined to correct their fault. Now i'm stucked in this hard place. I saved enough money but i can't buy a house because of bad credit. I feel so helpless because it is so hard to fight against the system. Evidently, i have paid off my loan. I have only one student loan. But sloppy report from Sallie Mae lead lender to believing that have not paid off the degratory account ( transfered account). My credit was from 780 down to 667. I could not get a mortgate loan. I lost 5000$ deposit on escrow. I can't buy a house."
2008-05-14 16:54:25,"El Paso, TX",Deandra,,"I received a notification from Equifax on 5/9/08 that my credit score had changed. When I went to the site, I was shocked to see that my credit score plummeted by 67 points due to a derogatory reporting by Sallie Mae on my student loan. I was and still am in shock; I have worked so hard to improve my credit score over the last few years and was preparing to purchase a home.  I emailed Sallie Mae through their Contact Us link on 5/10/08. I then called the 800 number on 5/13/08 only to be transferred to someone who I could not understand very well; he seemed to be reading from a scripted response. What I did gather from the Representative as that Sallie Mae inadvertently made a coding error just this one time for any account that had a reduced payment plan; they were all coded as delinquent, but the problem would be resolved as soon as possible. They also coded my account with a  new account number, and as making partial payments.  I checked my email later on 5/13/08 and had received a response from Sallie Mae instructing me to send them a copy of my credit report as credit problems could not be handled on-line.  My response email was not nice and I informed them that I would report this to every organization that I could until Sallie Mae corrected their ways.  If it were not for the services of Equifax, I would never have known of this injustice. To date, Sallie Mae has not notified me in any way of their coding error; if I had not contacted them, I would never have known.  I informed Sallie Mae in my email that as a consumer, I am expected to be financially responsible in the use of credit and I expect them to be held to the same standards. If I defaulted on my loan with them, I am sure that there would be a little more urgency in your resolution plan. I further informed them that this is an urgent situation to me, and I do not appreciate being instructed to unworriedly write, mail, or fax documentation for something Sallie Mae not only did, but also is fully aware of. What I do expect is that the information submitted on my credit report be corrected expeditiously, not as soon as possible, or in the next reporting period.The damage is astronomical. No one will provide someone with credit where my numbers are now, and the score is not correct but my creditors do not know this; all they see are numbers.  Also, variable credit rates are tied to my credit score; I cannot imagine what is going to happen to all the hard work I have done. Regardless of whether I purchase a home or not, my credit score is now in one of the lowest categories. I am stressed, upset, and worried about the consequences this will have on my life. What makes it so bad is that Sallie Mae seem to they could care less about what has happened to me and apparently many others."
2008-05-13 23:30:51,"Baltimore, MD",Shannon,,"My husband and I had a small computer training loan from Sallie Mae in 2002.  It had deferred payment for three months.  When I received the first statement I called for the payoff amount and sent a check for the full payoff.  Fast forward to April 2008 ... we start to receive letters and start to be harassed by phone calls saying that we owe $445.00.  We called customer service (all 15 phone numbers and departments we were given and transferred to) only to find out they had applied my $11,000 payoff toward future payments.  The negative balance accrued interest for six years.  We had no correspondence or statements the entire time.  When we call to get help we are constantly hung up on and transferred to different departments.  Most often times we are sent right back to the main phone number.  We have faxed the cancelled check.  We have been told to wait for a letter, and all we get are delinquent statements.  Is there a class action law suit.  This company is a scam and inherently why so many young people are worried about their future and the future of this country."
2008-05-12 23:44:10,"Beverly Hills, CA",Michelle,,"I recently was alerted by a credit score watch service that new derogatory information had been reported on my credit reports.  As I am applying for my first mortgage loan, I knew that my credit had to be nothing short of stellar, so about three years ago, I began paying big chunks of my income and savings to pay my Sallie Mae Student Loan accounts down, if not pay them off entirely. To pay these loans down, I did not go on vacations, I scraped and I sacrificed.   When I graduated, I owed nearly $74,000 in student loans. Right now, I owe about $14,000, which is still alot, but I now feel that I have a good shot at paying it off and getting a good interest rate on a mortgage (or at least I had hoped.)    Low and behold, when I got my Equifax credit report, Sallie Mae had added a notation on my credit report arrangement made with credit grantor to make partial payments. Apparently this comment/notation caused Equifax's computers to go berserk and my student loan account is now being reported as seriously delinquent and the ENTIRE LOAN amount is showing as past due. Yes, the entire loan balance is showing as past due, not the monthly payment of around $165.    This is, of course, a joke, because I have been making larger than required monthly payments, aggressively paying down the principal. The account, according to their own website, is even in a pre-paid status, with the next payment due on April 2009.    I immediately called their 800 customer service number.  I asked to speak with a customer service supervisor.  She told me to fax her information, including copies of my credit reports, showing the drop in my credit score (my credit score dropped 110 points). She promised to return my call.  As of this writing, I have not received a call back. When I call their customer service number to attempt to confirm receipt of the information she requested that I fax, I am told that I cannot speak with this person, but that another supervisor can help me.  I then have to explain the situation all over again.    It is beyond comprehension to me that Sallie Mae can harass and call someone who is past due on their accounts repeatedly with impugnity. Yet, when they are wrongfully reporting you as being delinquent to the credit bureaus, when you are in fact, pre-paid and have never been late on your account, causing serious damage to your credit scores and impeding your ability to get a mortgage or any type of new credit, they do not make the promised return calls, nor do they respond to your correspondence.  Something is definitely wrong with this picture.   Any class actions going against Sallie Mae's credit reporting practices? (I know of the class action against them alleging discriminatory lending practices.)      I am currently applying for a mortgage loan. Because my credit score dropped by over 100 points (from mid 700's to low 600's) due their falsely reporting my student loan as seriously delinquent, I would be hard pressed to be approved for a loan, even with a subprime lender at double digit interest rates.    The Federal Trade Commission/Dept of Education/States Attorneys General need to investigate Sallie Mae and their business practices and credit reporting policies.    I am still trying to deal with Sallie Mae to get this situation corrected. If not, I will sue them under FCRA.  If I do not get approved for a mortgage, or if I get one at double digit interest rates, my damages will be tens of thousands of dollars (if not hundreds of thousands because I live in CA). All because of their negligence and carelessness in the way they report to the credit bureaus."
2008-05-12 16:43:14,"Chicago, IL",Matt,,"Well, I attended Full Sail and took out about $87,000 total for schooling through Sallie Mae. My monthly total comes to about $852/mo. I recently went through a child custody battle that cost me about $13,000 and has to be paid back by July 3rd, 2008 or it will hurt the two people that helped me. I've been trying to use my forbearance since January 29, 2008 and was told I make to much money to get a forbearance no matter my circumstances. I don't have a problem paying them, but I can't right now until I get back on my feet...not to mention I am a single family income with a fiance and an 11 month old son. I submitted my forbearance request AGAIN for the 4th time, May 6, 2008 with 7 pages of legal documentation proving I can not pay them now. They keep pushing me back and back saying oh you'll get a notice tomorrow and when tomorrow arrives they say tomorrow again. I get harassing phone calls all day long (sometimes 10 calls a day even though they know I'm waiting for approval EVEN ON SUNDAY at 9PM!!!!!). I thought forbearance was there when you need it not based on how much money you make a year. I feel helpless and have no way out, but making my credit score drop like an anvil...The consequences are becoming overwhelming. If I don't pay them my credit will go down, I don't feel comfortable even buying groceries because I have to pay them, if I can't pay and my credit goes down...I'll never be able to buy a home, I feel harassed and powerless almost abused would be a better term. Economically I make 60,000/yr: I have a car payment, mandatory insurance, $13,000 in lawyer loans that are in my mom's name and a friend's name, $800/mo rent, Utilities, baby food, formula, diapers. I am going insane and nobody can help!!!!!"
2008-05-11 19:10:03,"York, PA",Maria,,"I moved to Atlanta, Ga in 2005.  Three months later I began attending ITT Tech in Kennesaw majoring in Criminal Justice.  I attended ITT for 16 months, I then transferred to Westwood College for the same program but under the assumption I would graduate sooner.  During my time attending these schools I used Sallie Mae.  To make a long story short, I returned to PA.  A few months ago, I began to receive statements from Sallie Mae for repayment status.  When I seen the amount owed, I cried.  I called ITT Tech about the loans I applied for and received, they told me that I applied for a certain amount and only received half the amount applied for.  The loan amount I received from ITT was only $26,000.  The loans with Westwood was only $4,000.  I then spoke with a rep from Sallie Mae and he told me that I received 8 full loans and that my total loan amount is $38,000.  Due to capatilized interest and that from the day I signed the promissary note the interest has been accruing since that day, and the interest rates are variable.  He then told me I would have 10-15 years to repay the loan(s) amounts and doing so the total amount I would have paid is $68,000 because of the interest still accruing on each individual loans I have.  Basically, each loan I received in a half amount, they considered a full amount and applied different interest amounts to each one of them.  My monthly payments are $530.00 a month.  I can't afford this.  The messed up thing about this situation I didn't graduate.  When I asked them about consolidating the loans, their response was 1) in order to consolidate my loans with them I would have to be a graduate, 2) have excellent credit, 3) have a co-signor with excellent credit.The physical damage that can result from this is my credit.  If I don't pay them my credit will be distroyed. A situation like such deters people for wanting to attend and/or return to school.  When I spoke to the finanacial aid rep at ITT, she told me to call Sallie Mae and ask for a forebearance, return to school, graduate, work on my credit, and then try to consolidate.  If I were to do this the interest on the loans will continue to accrue and I will end up paying the loan three times.  We as students need some type of advice on how to go about this.  Because we will be in debt for the rest of our lives.  How will we be able to plan and/or take care of ourselves let alone a family if there are businesses like Sallie Mae out there taking advantage of the student?  I am willing to pay the amounts disbursed to me, because I know I did use the money for schooling, but I am not willing to pay the huge interest amounts that will accrue over the next 10-15 years.  PLEASE I REALLY NEED SOME TYPE OF CONSULTATION AND A SOLUTION TO MY PROBLEM."
2008-04-23 23:13:25,"Ocean View, NJ",Matthew,,"I took out a small loan with salle mae to attned Harris School of business.  Ive paid of student loads with VSAC, so I knew paying back loans is something Im able and willing to do.  My house burned down - I lost everything, including my little brother.  A month later my job was terminated.  I continued to pay sallie mae my monthly payments untill I eventually ran out of money.  Ironicly at that point the bills stoped comming, I wasnt sure why.  3 months later I get a call saying I owe $600 dollers in late fees.  They asked to verify my address, and they had been sending my bills to Maryland.  I have never set foot in maryland.  Due to thier  error I did not get a bill for 3 months - I paid them the $600 dollers, the last ammount in my bank account.  The day after I made that payment  they started calling me almost 5 times a day, it hasnt stoped.  So it seems even when IM caught up with the payments they still call me and say I am late.  My bill says one ammount while the agent on the phone says I owe a higher ammount.  I want to pay this loan off, but IM still searching for a place to live, and finding work is proving to be a task of its own.  I just cant believe sallie mae wont work with me to help me out.  does anyone have any ideas?I havnt slept more than 2 hours a night for the last 7 months,  IM constantly feeling like IM failing at life.  Every time I get one of those calls  and a person tells me how  much I owe and how bad of a person I am for not paying, Im starting to believe them.  The moment I start to get paid they will too."
2008-04-23 15:00:20,"Elizabeth, NJ",Carmen,,"In 2006 I attended NJCU. In order to attend the university I had to apply for a loan through Sallie Mae.  I submitted all the necessary paperwork to complete the loan process. In March, I was told to sign a promissory note to close the deal; so I did. Months later I received a notice stating there is a hold on my account due to non-payment.  I then contacted the financial aid office; I was told the promissory note was not signed and the loan was canceled.  I now have a collection agency calling me demanding payment.  I once again called NJUC and explained the situation; the financial rep. said to me the loan was canceled by Sallie Mae.  I then called Sallie Mae and was told the promissory note was received on March 16th 2007, on July 1st the money was ready for disbursement and was put on a hold by the school, she then said on Sept 15 2007 it was canceled by the school without reason.  My situation now is the loan cannot be reversed, I have to pay 3,768.25 cash, and it is in collection due to lack of communication with NJCU.  If I had the money to begin with I would have paid it; I have applied for school loans in the past and never had difficulties like I am having with NJCU.  Please advise me on what can be done to satisfy this matter.   Thank You.I was reported to a collection agency due to NJCU incompetence."
2008-04-21 18:55:46,"Phoenix, AZ",Lisa,,"This was a salliemae services student loan that was paid off in jan 2007 (25,000 pay off).  Somehow got turned over to diversified collections and they have been harrassing me for payment since march of 2007. I keep telling them to contact salliemae because this debt has been paid. I have contacted salliemae with registered mail to alert them that I am being harassed and explained my situation with no avail, even speaking to a customer service rep in the US. They cannot solve the problem and I am tired of them making 3rd party contacts to my relatives telling them I owe money.My 90 year old grandmother was contacted and told that I am not paying my bills. She called me all worried and I had to explain it to her. They have called my parents and made it sound like if I didn't pay they would assume my debt. I don't know them any money. My credit has been ruined and I have spent countless hours trying to figure out how to solve this problem. I can't afford a lawyer so I continue to be harassed."
2008-04-15 23:02:31,"Pleasant Prairie, WI",Teresa,,"Capitalizing intrest is nothing more than compounding intrest.  I was lead to believe that compounded intrest on a loan was illegal in the United States.  If that is the case, how can Sallie Mae and other student loan companies get away with doing this?  I originally took out several loans to finish school and the end total was around $35,000.  When I had to consolidate the loans because there were too many from different sources, I did not have the capitalized intrest, but Sallie Mae bought the loans from the original company that I was doing business with and they capitalized the intrest without my consent.  I didn't even know that the company I was dealing with got bought out until I got a letter from  Sallie Mae, at which time I called them to ask them why they said I owed them money since I had never dealt with them before.  Now the intrest has compounded through this consolidation and my student loans now total $72,000.  I believe this is wrong. I also believe it is wrong that Americans have to pay for college education to begin with considering all the people we have to deal with from other countries in our work place do not enter the work place in debt from college because their governments actually pay for them to go to school, but that is another complaint.I have not been able to pay much on my student loans to begin with, but after the consolidation, there is no way that I can pay anything on my student loans.  I can't find a job in my field, and the retail job I am forced to work to survive does not pay me enought to pay all my bills and my student loans.  My loans are not in default that I know of, but they are definatly collecting more intrest as time goes on.  I have no way to pay these student loans.  I am just happy that they can not take anything I have away from me for owing them money, or can they?  I am not too sure what to do."
2008-04-12 19:41:10,"Aptos, CA",Erik,,"I called for a payoff amount on my student loans.  A check was sent in the amount quoted by Sallie Mae, and I later found out that I had made an overpayment of $4000 which was credited to my account.  After requesting that the overpayment amount be returned to me via check, I was informed that it would take up to 30 days to receive my money.  It has now been six weeks.  When I call to inquire about the refund, I am constantly given the run-around, and told that the issue will be looked into and I will be contacted within two to three days.  Sallie Mae has never called to clarify why the repayment check has not been sent out.  My first issue with this situation is the fact that I was over-quoted by $4000 dollars.  How can a Sallie Mae customer service representative make a $4000 error (four months worth of interest on my loan)?  Basic math skills are generally required to work in finance aren't they?  Consumers including myself are charged compounding interest on a daily basis, but no interest will be added to the amount owed to me.  In my opinion they owe me $4000 plus four months worth of interest at 8% APR.  My second issue is the amount of time Sallie Mae has put off paying me what is rightfully mine.  One month to cut a check?  With a deadline that is about ten times what is needed to accomplish this basic task, they have already surpassed it by over two weeks.  No explanation is ever given, and no clarification as to when the check will be mailed has been communicated.  Third, the constant promises of follow up.  Sallie Mae representatives told me verbatim that they promise to call me with in three days.  Two supervisors and one operator have made such promises, and not one has lived up to them.  What kind of moral integrity do we have running our educational finance in this country?  Overall I am absolutely discussed by the level of service and basic treatment (or lack thereof) of Sallie Mae customers by it's employees. If this were any other industry, offences such as these would not be tolerated.  I am owed money plus interest.  Sallie Mae should be scrutinized as much as Bear Stearns or American Airlines for their lack of decent business practices.I am out $4000 plus interest with no idea when it will be returned to me.  When asked to provide proof that an overpayment was made, my bank (Wachovia) faxed the canceled checks.  Still, my phone calls are passed on to supervisors who promise to follow up.  Needless to say, follow up never occurs."
2008-04-01 19:44:19,"Temple, TX",Candice,,I have read many of the complaints against SallieMae on this website. I am a former employee of theirs and I understand the heartache of everyone on here. I don't like the way the company is being run and am so glad that I got out when I did. I went through extensive training for the federal loans that they provide but once I was put on the floor to help customers I was not given the opportunity to do what I felt was right. I left SallieMae in 2006 (I only worked there for about 8 months) because I couldn't take it anymore. There are some good people working there but they don't last very long and as I said the representatives aren't given much choice but to forward 'difficult' calls to someone higher (which are usually rude or just don't care). I wish I could help ALL of you guys with your problems.Shame of working for this company is the only damage that has resulted. And I think that is horrible enough.
2008-03-30 14:00:04,"Inkster, MI",Andre,,"I called to see if we could come up with a settlement for my loan and they treated me horribly. After hanging up on me a few times we came to a settlement. It was for $2,900 and after I paid they stated that I was getting a fax letter but I never got it. They claim it was send out but till this day I have never received a letter or fax in the mail or otherwise. When I call Mr Marvin Nickles he transfers me and then the line goes dead. Now they got their money and now they don't want to deal with me. I have been calling them everyday now trying to speak  to a mgr/sup and have been getting the same runaround. The other day I was on the phone for 2 hours being transfered. Is there any help out there? Is there a corporate number where someone can help me with this? I just want to get my settlement letter."
2008-03-26 17:26:53,"Inola, OK",Zanna,,"My adult son took out a student loan with SallieMae to go to welding school in Tulsa. He has since graduated and refuses to keep any job and stays in cognito most of the time. I never know where he is staying or who he is staying with. SallieMae has began to harrass me because he used me as a reference. They call me constantly wanting to know where he is. They act as if I'm lying when I tell them that I do not have an address or phone number for him. Now when they call or send me letters, I've gotten to where I don't answer and the letters goes in the trash. What is the use in wasting my time with these idiots? And I dare them to try and get me to pay his bill. He's an adult and on his own. I'm only his mother and I'm NOT responsible for his debts!!! I never co-signed for him. I knew he wasn't going to pay it back, I sure didn't want to be held responsible for it!!!"
2008-03-23 23:23:40,"Indianapolis, IN",Brian,,"I have had nothing but problems with Sallie Mae since graduating college and paying on the loans I have through them. To begin with, I had a grace period after I graduated of 6 months and I was waiting for a bill to come in the mail. Well it never came. It was about 3 months later and I never got a bill from them and in that time racked up late fees. Now I have recently applied to have my loans consolidated so I could have lower monthly payments. Little did I know that I would be charged a 43,000 dollar finance charge for doing this on top of my original loan amount of $25,000. So I now owe them 68,000 dollars and this is on a variable interest rate. I have to pay interest on top of a huge finance charge like that? That is a scam if you ask me. I would never have consolidated if I knew this was going to happen. I didn't get a huge fee like that when I consolidated my fed loans with Chase Bank. I almost forgot to mention the fact that my monthly payment amount was about $410 and is now $290. So is it really worth consolidating? I say no.This has put me in even more debt and I have had trouble sleeping because I can't stop thinking about all the extra money I will be paying them now."
2008-03-17 22:08:20,"Vallejo, CA",Elenora,,"I am a co-signer on a loan for my Granddaughter in 2004 and 2005. There were four separate transactions totaling $64,319.  The total of these loans, as of March 2007, is $81,000.  My Granddaughter has been allowed to and granted, Forbearance on at least two occasions, without my knowledge or approval.  The amount that I signed for I felt I could handle.  I am a senior on a fixed income, and this loan is growing beyond my means.  My Granddaughter has been very uncooperative, and I only found out that there was a problem when she stopped communicating with me.  I find there is a problem when the letters and automated calls begin arriving non-stop from SallieMae.  I know that I am responsible to make these payments, which have grown to $859.00 a month, and take up most of my Social Security check now, but what can I do to stop SallieMae from allowing her to avoid starting to pay off this loan by signing up for a few units?  This activity seems, in my opinion, to alter the terms of the original agreement by adding thousands of dollars in interest.  My contact with SallieMae representatives is frustrating to say the least.  The only advice I get from them is that I should just make the payments regardless of the loan being in forbearance.   That is not a solution, it merely lets the student off the hook and makes me the primary payer.  As stated above, I am a 70 year old senior on a fixed income. My phone started ringing at 8:00 each morning on Monday morning and continued each day for 8 days even after I called them to let them know I was trying to contact the student and her mother.  Oddly enough, it was then that I found out that she had been granted another forbearance, and that the late payment would be taken care of when she returned the paper work. Mind you I had also received letters saying that they did not have current information for her.  I have turned off the ringer on my phone and mailed them the amount overdue.  I have high blood pressure, take medication for a rapid heartbeat,and have fought insomnia.  I am already having bouts of anxiety over this growing debt.  Once I make contact, I don't understand why the calls don't stop."
2008-03-11 13:06:38,"Brooklyn, NY",Catherine,,"I requested an increase of my monthly payments back in December 2007. I wanted to pay off my student loans faster.  I got a notice in January saying that my payments were going to increased to $3,133 a month (my initial payments were $400/month and I wanted them increased to $550/month). I was shocked. I called Sallie Mae immediately and customer service told me it was a mistake and that the money would not get deducted. It was. It drained my checking account and caused me to get slapped with several overdraft charges. It's now almost two months later. I have not been reimbursed even though they say that I have. My Sallie Mae account indicates that I did not pay $3,133 so now I owe them twice. Sallie Mae is one of the worst corporations in America. I had to drain my savings account to beef up my checking account as well as borrow money from friends to keep two rent checks from bouncing. I won't be able to pay next month's rent if I don't get reimbursed soon. It's been a real depressing situation. I feel like I am in school again - poor and scared."
2008-03-10 12:40:32,"La Crosse, WI",Anthony,,"Aside from the fact that the payments I have made account for only a small, small percentage of the principle, I am furious with Sallie Mae for having found me in default on the basis of identity theft.  When I was going to Full Sail in Winter Park, FL, I had spoken with my co-signer (my dad) about applying for the second half of the loan which would cover the rest of the tuition.  (Full Sail is extremely expensive and I regret going there.)  Jump to about a year or more after graduation: my co-signer (my dad) forgot that he approved this loan (which I took care of electronically) and filed a fraud report with Sallie Mae  in order to have his name removed from the loan.  This led to Sallie Mae sending me a letter completely out of the blue telling me that I committed identity theft and therefore am in default on a $31,000 loan.  I have three loans with Sallie Mae because of Full Sail, with an original principle of around $84,000 without interest and a continually growing amount with interest of over $100,000.  Financially, I'm ruined.  I'm stuck living with my co-signer (my dad).  My relationship with my father has been pushed to the limit."
2008-03-10 10:53:35,"East Haven, CT",Antonio,,"Wow...I wish I had looked up this type of site, to start my complaint about Sallie Mae.  I think they should pay for their own people to go to college.  There is no common sense, anymore.  This is because they are given some written &quot;to-say&quot; lists, and they don't need to use their brain cells. I have been in college for the past 5 years and had to deal with Sallie Mae quite a few times to incredible disappointment and shock  that these people could be so stupid.  I didn't even get anywhere by speaking (after a billion requests) to a supervisor. One year before graduation, in the summer, they sent me the first bill. I called them, and they told me that I was in repayment because I wasn't attending college.  Funny!  1) They just disbursed my loan to the college for me to attend classes; 2) At that time, I hadn't finished college, yet.  So, where is the grace period? I graduated in May '07. I called them in June to consolidate my loans.  Spoke to someone in the US, and after playing with numbers I agreed to consolidate to a great interest rate, after (of course) all the discounts, auto-pay, etc.  She told me it would be consolidated in July.  Well, in August, I signed up for the MBA program, and Sallie Mae sent me a letter with all my loans.  Guess what?  No consolidation was done, and the interests were higher than originally. I called them and, of course, they give you these reasons that don't hold because of timing.  In the meantime, I am the one paying for their mistakes, or better--for them not doing anything. They are the worst company to do business with.  The reps are lazy, management doesn't care, executives can't be reached, and students pay the price of a so-incompetent company.  Forget escalating your issues.  It will take you forever to talk to a manager, which would not take you anywhere because he/she is still reading a piece of paper and uncapable of using some brain.  I will get my loans out of Sallie Mae."
2008-03-10 10:48:12,"Norwood, MA",Sarah,,"My problem with Sallie Mae Financial started on 2/25/08 when I received an e-mail stating that I was over $400.00 behind on my loan. I called that day and spoke with Dottie and told her that I am current with my loan and want to know why I received this e-mail. After doing some research, she stated that the payment were being applied only to one loan. (I currently have 3 loans with Sallie Mae). I told her that I only receive one bill and send in one payment and have been doing so for the last 8 years. She stated that she would send this to the research dept. and have it resolved. I then received a phone call from Joe on 2/26, and I relayed what Dottie told me on 2/25; and he said that the request was sent in and that it should be taken care of. I then receive a call from Roslynn on 2/28, and she was extremely rude and unprofessional and told me that I needed to be specific about where to apply the loan. When I disagreed w/ her, she hung up on me. I immediately called back (and mysteriously it was down to $200) and spoke with Greg--and was hung up on by him as well when I stated that I have proof of the last 6 months of payment. I immediately called back again, and again he hung up on me. I immediately called back and finally spoke with someone who did not lack the basic customer service skills required for the job; her name was Rebecca. She stated that it was not in fact applied to just one loan and that the problem was that they don't have record of October payment. I spoke with several other people which I have record of, and what I owe changes with each call. I faxed in proof of Oct, Nov, Dec--which they said they didn't receive the fax. Today 3/10 when I spoke with Malcolm (ID: LUMXA1). He stated that they have records of payments and doesn't know why I am receiving harassing phone calls. I don't know how many people they are attempting to rip off, but I for one will not stand for it. Also, I have demanded, several times that they send me a payment history, and they have yet to do so.  It makes me wonder how many people they are doing this to and how often they are getting away with it?This is possibly ruining mine as well as my co-signer's credit.  I have proof of payments, and they also have it in their system and are still refusing to resolve it."
2008-03-04 20:25:02,"North Charleston, SC",Latoya,,"I went to a career training school that used Sallie Mae as their lender. I was misled from the beginning. While in school I was only supposed to be paying $10.00 per month, but shortly after receiving the loan my payments jumped to $30.00 per month. I have been paying on this loan since July 2006. I only received about $496.00 from Sallie Mae, but I have paid well over $1200.00 in repayments. I am a single parent and feel like I was taken advantage of. I advised Sallie Mae that I was having a financial hardship and needed to either reduce my payments or stop them. No one was willing to work with me. I was basically told either you pay or my federal income tax was in jeopardy of being taken. I struggled to get the money up to pay them. On 3/1, I paid the amount online that  I was told to pay to clear the balance and emailed Sallie Mae to send me a paid in full letter. I received a response telling me that I owe $17.00 more  for March, and if that is not paid then I will be hit with a late payment fee. I feel like Sallie Mae is taking advantage of students and needs to be investigated.I have been going through a lot of stress behind this situation. I have been put in the situation where I had to choose between meals and payment to avoid further harassment from this company. I will never recommend Sallie Mae to anyone."
2008-02-26 14:29:55,"St. Louis, MO",Jenny,,"I am at a total loss for words.  I think my college might be more responsible for this (at least that's what SallieMae says).  I was trying to get into school to become a paralegal.  I chose Hickey College, which was a terrible mistake.  First off, I did not want to use Sallie Mae because of all the horror stories.  But my financial aid officer said I had to use them because Hickey will not allow me to use anyone else.  That was a LIE.  Then they tell me I need a co-signer because in the state of Missouri you must be 25 years of age to be able to sign for yourself.  So after weeks of arguing with my single mother of 6 kids, she agreed to COSIGN.  While in school, I was the only student to be kicked out of class and threatened to be expelled if I did not make my loan payments.  I wasn't even graduated yet!?  I had to borrow the money from my grandparents every month.  Like I stated before, I was the ONLY student this happened to.  Then comes time to pay my loans after school.  My interest rate is that of a mortgage payment, and worst of all, I get no credit for what I am paying.  I am paying on 2 loans (I only took out one) and Hickey College went behind my back and changed my mother from co-signer to primary so I would be approved.  Now Sallie Mae and Hickey College tell me I have to pay those loans or my credit will be ruined, yet I get no credit for it cause it's in my mothers name!  I am furious and I want to sue!  It is not about making the payments (which I can barely do), it is about getting the credit I deserve for something I did and am paying for.I am totally broke for nothing.  I cannot continue my education because I cannot get a loan.  Meanwhile, my mother is getting the credit for all my hard work.  Is there anything I can do?"
2008-02-24 17:36:51,"Hillside, CA",Bianita,,"During my four years of school I needed loan assistance since my parents wouldn't pay out of pocket. My relative cosigned on my loan through Nellie Mae. My loan was bought a year later by Sallie Mae and I singed a new promisary note. Every year thereafter Sallie Mae dispursed loans to my college account for the remainder of my tuition balance after scholarships and such, without us needing to fill out any additional paperwork. The interest was deferred.  When I graduated in June 06, I received my payment booklet in late July. My loan principal balance at that time was $19,241.41 My first loan payment was due on December 28. On September 14th, I received a letter saying my loan capitalized to $31,468.83.  When you finally get through on the line the best thing is to ask for a transfer to the US office, and you can speak to someone who speaks English.    We managed to get the phone number of a US sallie mae person by saying my phone is about to die, do you have a direct line that I can call you right back? I've been transfered around a lot and finally reached you, who can help me. Another time we got a U.S. fax number and messed around calling numbers in succession until we reached a U.S. Sallie Mae person. It may be rude, but it works well when you get to speak to an American.  Anyways, when I called and asked why this was, they told me it was outlined in my promisary note. The woman on the phone was very patient with me and we found together the paragraph on the pdf promisary note that states other fees as applies. One small line included capitalization fees. The reason for the high capitalization fee was because my relative who cosigned had just retired, changing their financial status (blah blah blah). It was explained to me that because my loan was deferred that the interest would be added to my principal and Capitalized on the date of the year that the loan was first received. I thought it made sense and decided I could deal with it.   In October I received another letter that my Loan capitalized once again. This time to $48,133.35. This freaked me out so I called them again. This was because my loan one year was received on the date that this capitalized. Putting two and two together, this meant I was going to have two more capitalizations?   My family and I went to get an equity loan to pay the monster off but a two weeks later received another letter on October 31st. The loan had then capitalized to $64,286.11.   The next date anticipated date for it to capitalize was Dec. 29. My parents refinanced their home and paid off the debt before even my first payment was scheduled to be due!  This is what we discovered in the process about how this was possible. In 1997 the president signed the Education reform act which would ensure any student who applied for an education loan would be able to receive a loan, which gave lending companies like Sallie Mae the special power to do this type of thing (short story but you can read more online about it).   What I don't understand is why they needed to capitalize so much and second HOW they even calculated the fees. I couldn't even come up with a math equation to understand how they got their numbers. Our agent at the bank couldn't calculate these amounts either.   My best friend from college was more unlucky than I, he ended up after all the fees owing $640,000+ from borrowing only $140,000 for school. His also capitalized before the due date of the very first payment. He has since given up on trying to attempt to pay it back. My family had an exceptional loan rep at our bank who had dealt with SallieMae in the past.  She estimated the daily interest and added it to the amount on the capitalization letter, then tacked onto that a thousand dollars extra to the fixed rate equity we finally received. Sure enough her expectations where correct and we were able to pay in full before the first loan payment was ever due. In just the time between October 31 and December 27 there was over a thousand in interest added.  I just have sympathy for the individuals this happens to who do not have relatives with the financial capability to nip this in the bud.  The bank told us it would have been cheaper in the long run to pay for school on credit card or home equity to begin with and we would have saved over $40,000 dollars."
2008-02-23 19:50:35,"Glenshaw, PA",Deborah,,"Two of my daughters attended New York University. They went to the student financial aid office to obtain student loans for 1 year. They were told that Sallie Mae was the best financial arrangement for their loans and that interest would not accumulate until they graduated. They filled out the paperwork and told us our signatures were required, and based on what they had been told, we signed. We did not read the papers closely, since they were voluminous and our daughters said that the NYU student aid office said this was a great deal! When our older daughter graduated, we were horrified to learn that the interest rate was 14%--more than twice what we could have secured the loans for on our own, and the interest was accumulating while they were still in school.We immediately paid off the principal balance of both loans. We were further outraged to find out that Sallie Mae bribed student financial aid offices to lie to the students to induce them to take out these incredibly usurious loans. In addition, this is a private commercial lender, and its executives have spent outrageous sums of money on themselves and the bribery scheme involving schools and politicians. We are not pursuing legal action against them for their fraud; however, we are NOT paying them any money above the principal balance as the loans were secured under fraudulent circumstances. Sallie Mae has continued to harass us for interest on one of the loans. They call our house at least 5 and sometimes 8 times a day. We have told them the loans have been paid in full and to stop calling. Instead they have stepped up the calls. This is outrageous. No student EVER should borrow from this company. Sallie Mae has threatened and harassed us and has filed a negative report on our credit report."
2008-02-23 09:44:02,"Bradenton, FL",Lizet,,"I enrolled myself at Keiser University, Sarasota campus.  Their financial aid office completed my original financial aid forms for my tuition.  I had no idea that it was Sallie Mae; it was simply presented as a school loan that I would have to start paying paid back 6 months after I completed my studies.  (I won't be done with school until December 2009). My father co-signed with me because I don't have good credit.  It all seem fair enough at the time until I started getting phone calls sometimes 3-4 times daily from Sallie Mae.  The loans that the school had me sign for, are not loans that I will start paying for at the end of my college career; they are loans that I am being harassed to pay for now.  I say harassed because there is no other word to use for the way they handle their accounts. It's mental harassment that is very upsetting for someone who has high blood pressure. Even the day after I've made a payment, they are calling.  I always end up owing them more money. I just received a call from them; it was 9:00 in the AM, and it's Saturday.  I promised a payment on the 15th of March, and that is not enough and conveniently never notated on the account; they continue to call.  I moved in with my parents because they are both ill, and they are not only harassing me but are also harassing my parents.  Calling won't change the fact that someone doesn't have the money to make a payment everyday. I am so sorry to have gone back to school.  I am a citizen; I love this country, but when did it stop being the land of opportunity?  If I were the only person with this situation I would understand, but most of the people who have Sallie Mae loans are thrown in hell for the rest of their adult life.  You are damned if you don't go to school and damned twice if you do.  Their interest rates are ridiculous, and consolidating isn't much better. How is anyone who isn't rich supposed to get an education in this country?  Does the middle man count at all?  How can you get Sallie Mae to stop calling at all hours and every day of the week without selling them your kidney?  Aren't student loans supposed to be paid back when you are done with school?  My blood pressure was so high because of all the stress these phone calls cause me, I had to go to the doctor and have my medication changed because the one I was taking was not longer effective.  My parents are not well and are being upset by Sallie Mae. I lost my job and was looking for 6 months.  I started my new job 3-1/3 months ago making less money than I was at my previous employer.  I am barely getting back on my feet. I've told them this, and I think it encouraged them to call even more.  I am terrified that they will get my new employer's phone number and start calling me there. These hounding phone calls are causing stress that is unhealthy for  both my parents and myself.  I am not close to being done with school.  Why am I being called consistently and hounded by these people?  Don't we have rights as students and consumers?"
2008-02-22 11:55:55,"Philadelphia, PA",Joy,,"I graduated with a degree in architecture and over $80,000 in student loans.  About 50% of these loans are with Sallie Mae.  I was unable to find decent employment for about 8 months following graduation in 2007.  Until this January, I was working as a secretary for a residential architect making about $10/hour.  The total of my student loan payments equaled about $1100 per month--I was only taking home $1400.   Thankfully, I recently became more gainfully employed and have been working with financial advisers and a credit counselor to construct a livable budget.  My monthly expenses total around $1750 per month leaving me with about $600 to pay off loans and save some money--SOME being the highly operative word; because if I paid even a significant fraction of my student loan debt per month, I'm left with nothing to save for emergencies, the future (what future?), etc.  I have been able to place loans from Direct Loans in forbearance for now, and I'm seeking forbearance for my AES loans.  When I sought paperwork from Sallie Mae to apply for forbearance, I was told that I would have to pay a $150 forbearance fee.  This would give me relief for about four months, after which, regular payment obligations would resume.  The livable payment plan that I proposed to them in a letter sent about three weeks ago (along with correspondence from my credit counselor and my monthly detailed budget) was not mentioned.  I brought it up and was told that that was simply not an option.  Since my finances are currently in triage, and I have no idea when or if they will ever recover, there is no way that I will be able to make the total monthly payments to any of my three lenders.  Every attempt that I've made to professionally correspond with Sallie Mae to establish a LIVABLE payment plan has been met with smug indifference, threats, and unrealistic expectations.  I've given up being concerned with how my student loan burden will affect my credit, because it is already shot.  It was perfect before I decided to finish school about five years ago. So much for the education that was supposed to ensure me a better life.  I would have been better off hopping trains across country and selling crafts at flea markets along the way.  I'd have perfect credit, no debt, and I'd be in exactly the same economic rung--maybe higher."
2008-02-21 11:13:27,"Whippany, NJ",David,,"I don't know where they are coming up with the amounts they are charging.  One example I looked about 2 months ago and they claimed i owed them 87,000.  I looked yesterday and now its 93,000.  I have over 23,000 in interest yet i don't even know how they came up with that.  I've tried to consolidate but can't without a co-signer and who will co-sign for what is now $93,000.  I haven't completely broken it down to exact figures but just by estimates its OFF way off.  This seems to be a repeated problem with my school loans.  I try to follow them and keep track of everything but the numbers seem to never add up to what they say the bill is and it feels like i'm getting charged by the same companies a few times and its not deducting from what i owe or even that a few companies are charging me for the same thing.  how long does it usually take a recent graduate to pay for $93,000? with about 14% interest? My point exactly. Use your imagination for what its doing to my life, my marriage, my stress level.  And i've been trying to consolidate so i can make payments but i dont' have a co-signer."
2008-02-18 11:45:24,"Delmar, NY",Laura,,"In early 2007, I used the last of my forbearance with Sallie Mae to bring my loans current.  They told me that my loans would again be due in July.  About 3 weeks later, I received a call stating that my account was behind.  I went through a long process of providing them information that I had used my forbearance.  The representative stated that the forbearance had not been processed correctly and that they needed to do it again.  This was done and I was told that the forbearance would be moved now through August 21, 2007.  I received a bill in August stating that I was one month behind in payments.  I called and spoke with many representatives and they all claim that they can find no record of my calls (of course not--they admitted that they made an error when they called me!) and that I am responsible for paying for the extra payment as well as the late fees.  I explained how I felt that this was fraudulent, as they charged me the interest for the forbearance and were not expecting the payment as well as the late fee.  IF I had the funds to pay, I would not have asked for the forbearance in the first place!They are charging me late fees for the month that I did not pay (as it was in forbearance at that time) and it is being reported to the credit bureau as being (currently) 28 days late.  I continue to pay on time current payments since then, but they still count that one payment as late."
2008-02-18 02:31:34,"Spokane, WA",Sally,,"My complaint is with Sallie Mae Student Loan company. After paying on my student loan for 8 years at $200.00 a month on a $19,000 student loan, it is now $23,000.00. My loan has been passed from Sallie Mae, ACS, AFSA, NELA and now of course the collection companies. Also, at the time of my consolidation with Sallie Mae, I set up a pay back payment plan that consisted of an automatic payment taken out of my account on the 28th of every month. While I was paying on this $19,000 loan, Sallie Mae makes a HUGE mistake and sent my consolidated loan to collections where it sat ruining my credit for 4 years. When I discovered the problem with my credit, I called Sallie Mae and asked for help to correct their mistake. THEY DID NOT HELP NOR DID THEY CARE. After 2 years of calls and letters, I was able to dispute the error with the 3 credit bureaus. But the error still remains on my credit report for all to question.  I have called the attorney general's office, and I am taking direction from them at this point. I have sent 3 certified letters this week, one to Sallie Mae, General Revenue Corp. and to Higher Education in Washington, DC. I will keep you posted; my loan is now at $32,000, and I am harassed by General Revenue daily. I am unemployed right now, and I owe Uncle Sam $3,000. Otherwise I was threatened that GR would be taking my tax return and 15% of my wages each month. As a single mom I was unable to buy a camera or computer on time with dept stores because of the Loan errors on my credit report I was turned down for 4 years straight. This is when I pulled my credit report and found the error, It's time for a class action law suit, why are we waiting. I also believe that the math formulas are in questions,,,, HELP"
2008-02-11 01:44:33,"Los Angeles, CA",Marilyn,,"While monitoring my credit I noticed that there were 5 discrepancies on my credit reports from transunion and experian from Sallie Mae.  I contacted Student Clearinghouse who reports to the credit bureaus and they stated that my 5 student loans were in deferment status and that they should not have been reported as 90 days late for the past two years.  I contacted the credit bureaus who stated to me that Sallie Mae reports to them the status. I contacted Sallie Mae and requested that they send me a letter admitting that they had made an error in not reporting that my loans were in deferment status. They admitted that my loans were in deferment status for that period but would not send the statement in writing; instead they sent me a letter that stated my request that my loans for that period be in deferment had been granted. Thereby, not accepting the the blame for their error and my credit score plummeting during the period of trying to refinance my home.  90 days late for five loans made me ineligible for a refinance.  Are Sallie Mae and the credit bureaus working together to cause people financial ruin? Is this contrived? I work with the at risk populations for meager salary compensation and yet even as I save the government money for services I perform for them, I am hurt by sallie mae who ruins my credit. When I first took out student loans in the 80's student loans were meant to help poor students who did not have endowments, trust funds, etc. to encourage those who could not otherwise attend college; but now they (sallie mae and the credit bureaus) are causing people with stress. Why are people who cannot understand English allowed to service these loans? I cannot understand them and they cannot understand me. Maybe sallie mae should employ some of us and let us work our debts off. I've lost thousands of dollars lost due to high interest rates charged due to bad credit thanks to sallie mae. I'm still trying to get my home refinanced."
2008-02-08 21:50:49,"Wichita, KS",Virginia,,"I have two loans with Sallie Mae.  Ever since around July of 2006 I have been repeatedly harassed by Sallie Mae about my payments.  I have been sent to collections 3 times in the last 8 months, and every time I get sent there, not only can collections not find any standing missing payments, but they can't even understand where the amount that they are demanding is coming from. I have also received threatening letters for each account stating that I haven't been paying them. So every time I get them, I call Sallie Mae and tell them that they are wrong, then they look up my account and see that all my payments are there, but they still threaten to send me to collections.  Then they send me to around five other people that have no idea how to fix the problem, and each one of them remind me that my account is in route to collections.  I swear they either promise to take care of it or request an investigation into my history.  They never do, so the next month rolls around and I'm stuck dealing with it again. Every time I get an investigation, I am supposed to get an answer within 7-10 business days.  The last time, they didn't send me an answer, they sent me a printout of the last three years of payments, and still couldn't find a single missing payment. So finally after my husband threatened them, they did not send me a threatening letter in December,  but they did send me a letter yesterday stating that they hadn't received my payment for January on either loan. So I checked their website and my bank account and both say that the payment was made and cleared the bank a day before it was actually due. I'm done. I decided that I'm going to fight back. I made a complaint on the local better business bureau. I decided that every time that they harass me, I'm filing a complaint on them. I suggest that you all do the same.  Every time they get complained against them, they have to fill out a folder full of paperwork. If they don't get the message, then maybe we should all get together and file a class action lawsuit against them.   They are trying as hard as they can to destroy my credit, that I have worked for years to become good. I have been ferociously ill for the last two years, and stress makes my illnesses like 100 times worse. In the last seven months, I have been in the hospital 3 times, two of which I was fighting for my life, was made worse by all the stress that they putting on me."
2008-02-06 21:44:16,"Bolingbrook, IL",Romer,,"My wife and I have a huge problem with sallie mae. I cannot believe that sallie mae could ruin our life. My wife had decided to take out a second mortgage so we can pay off sallie mae. Then we got everything taken cared of. We got approved and got the loan. Then I called sallie mae to ask about my balance and next thing you know, my loan went to General Revenue, thinking all my federal loans are transfered to that company, they told me I owe 28,000 dollars, that I still owe sallie mae 15 thousand dollars, and I still owe ziweker 15thousand dollars.My wife called in december or january just to check the balance and they told her 28thousand or less - how did they come up 15 thousand dollars interest? First of all we signed up for forberance and I spoke to one of the sallie mae's employees and she had told me that she received my letter regarding my foreberance. So, now we don't know what to do. This company is getting out of hand. It's bringing us down more in debt. School loans are expensive in the first place and then we lost our jobs and that's why it became defaulted. But they don't care about you losing your job, they just want to collect their money. I just hope that there is someone out there that straighten them out."
2008-02-06 09:06:28,"Sutton, MA",Sue,,"My troubles started with Sallie Mae in the Summer 2007 when I returned back to grad school and wanted to put my loans into deferment and forbearance.  I consolidated my Stafford Loans through Sallie Mae, and so far have not had any problems yet (that I am aware of).  I also have 2 private loans, one of which is giving me so much stress.  Last summer I filled out every form Sallie Mae told me to (four in total) and it was never the right one.  They called at least a dozen times a day, up until 9:00 P.M. Every time I spoke to someone, it was always a different story.  The representatives even hung up on me three time and yelled at me!  They were fresh, rude and harassing!  After 5 months, my forbearance was finally put through correctly.  It is now the next semester and I completed the forbearance form as I was supposed to and had it certified by my school.  It was again denied for missing information (the school certified it on the wrong line; at least, that was one of the responses I received from Sallie Mae).  I am now 41 days delinquent and getting the harassing phone calls again.  And once again, the representatives are rude and keep telling me I am 'all set' and it should be processed the next day.  Well it never is!  Something needs to be done with Sallie Mae.  I will NEVER recommend them to ANYONE!It is being reported to the credit bureaus as being delinquent."

After I was notified that my loans were in repayment and in collections, I immediately handled it accordingly.  On 2/1/2008, I spoke to Heather who is an Account Manager for Sallie Mae who started to pursue collection, but realized that all Sallie Mae needed was my signature.  I signed the forms as asked, PDF the document and e-mailed it directly to her.  However, I am still receiving threatening phone calls from Sallie Mae's collections department in an attempt to collect while I am still in school.  I want Sallie to stop HARASSING me immediately.  In addition, I would like to speak to an attorney if appropriate.So far, I am being told by Sallie Mae that they are going to send a negative report to the credit bureaus."

This has been going on since December!!!!!! Every time I call the 1-888 number, I get someone that I can't understand, nor do they understand the concept that most Americans have to take out student loans to further their education. These people are extremely condescending.They said that they are going to report me to the credit agencies. These people are ruining my life. I asked several times to speak to someone from America and the Indians won't give me the number. Also, I have no idea what happened to my personal information when I faxed it. I faxed check stubs, letters, loan info, all with my personal business on it. AND THEY SAID THEY DID NOT RECEIVE IT!!!!"
2008-01-25 16:49:16,"Culver City, CA",Patrick,,"After several days of being tossed around on the phone and passed to several different (and wrong) departments and having to give my private information every time I spoke to someone new, I blew up! I waited 3 days for a supervisor to call me back and she didn't!  I had finally had it. I called their toll-free number and when the computer asked for my information, I didn't give it. It recognized my phone number and sent me to customer service. The lady in India asked for my personal information again. I refused. I told her that either she pass me directly to the correct department or her supervisor. She said, she needed my information in order to process the request. I said, then give me to your supervisor. She said, Can I speak? I said, No. So then, Jason comes on and I told Jason of my problem, he asked for my information. I asked, Where do you live Jason? He said, India. I said, You need to connect me with someone in the United States Jason, I will be contacting the CEO regarding my problem. He did. I talked to a US representative who was able to handle the request in less than 20 minutes. Problem solved. Take a lesson from this. You have the right to deal with someone in the states, since this is where your loan was processed!"
2008-01-23 07:53:08,"Boston, MA",Chelsea,,"Sallie Mae claims my account is delinquent, they have added late fee penalties, and have sent my account to a collections agency.  When I try to call either Sallie Mae or the collection agency that is calling me at least twice a day (during the hours their automated message claims are their office hours) I am greeted by a message of We're sorry, our offices are closed, please call back during our open office hours.  I have been calling every day for two weeks now and I can't get anyone on the phone.  The amount they say I owe when I call does not match the amount their website claims I owe. The math on the website showing how my total has been determined does not add up.  I didn't even consolidate with this company!  This past summer I filed my application with Educational Direct NOT Sallie Mae, agreeing to begin making my student loan payments once my grace period expired.  However, no one, from either Educational Direct nor Sallie Mae has ever sent me a bill (via mail, email, or phone message) nor has anyone sent me any information saying what my monthly payment would be.  I am at my wits end.  I am 22 years old, just out of college, and I have worked hard to build my credit.  Something seems terribly wrong with this whole situation.  What should I do?Hundreds of dollars of late fees have been tacked onto my account; my account has been sent to collections; my credit is threatened"
2008-01-08 22:00:18,"Springfield, MO",J,,"I have six loans being handled by Sallie Mae (four federal and two private loans) that were created during the course of my schooling. Ever since they went into payback status in early 2007, I've always been late on my monthly Sallie Mae loan payment in some way or another. What's weird is that there's no explanation WHY we're late on it all the time. We either pay the amount listed on a paper bill we get in the mail (which we rarely receive) or pay the amount listed in manageyourloans.com, but we're still ALWAYS late and accruing late fees. We called SallieMae SEVERAL times over the course of the payback peroid, and were offered different resolutions and remedies to my late payment problems every time we called. &quot;Look at 'Account Summary' in manageyourloans.com and pay what you see in the 'Monthly Payment Amount' field&quot;, or &quot;Wait for a paper bill and pay what the bill requests&quot;, or &quot;Pay a little bit at the beginning of the month, and the rest in the middle of the month&quot;, etc, etc. Well, I'm still late all the time, and I'm still accruing late fees. Recently I started taking screenshots of manageyourloans.com. On November 19 2007, the 'Monthly Payment Amount' field stated that I owed $310.95. I took a screenshot of this webpage, and my wife scheduled that payment to be made on the day it was due through our online banking (12/28/2007). On January 5 2008, I checked manageyourloans.com to see how the payment was disbursed and found $253.14 had mysteriously appeared in the 'Past Due Amount' field... Huh? I compared this information with the screenshot I took in November, and the screenshot showed absolutely no mention of $253.14 being due at any time. So I looked at the current payment history and found the $310.95 was used to pay what was due on Dec 28, but I didn't know what the heck the $253.14 was all about. On January 8 2008, SallieMae promptly tacked a $20.00 fee on the new 'Past Due Amount' figure. I called SallieMae and demanded to talk to a supervisor, when I got Allen. At least I think he said his name was 'Allen', since I could hardly understand him through his decidedly non-English accent. Well, after about twenty minutes of muddling through language barriers with him on the phone, I got the late fees knocked off and the payment redistributed. He said that the $253.14 was for 'federal' loans, and the original $310.95 was for their private loans. I asked him if all six of my loans became due on the same day (28th of each month), and he affirmed that they were indeed set up that way. I then asked him why the federal loan due didn't appear along with the private loan on manageyourloans.com, and he didn't have any answer. So here I am, stuck with a loan that is literally impossible to pay on time. It's hard to say how long this has been going on before I started taking screenshots, but I imagine it's been going on the entire time I've been paying back my loan since I've never been 'on time' even though I've paid whatever was requested via paper bills or on SallieMae's website. What do I do, and is there any legal action I can take?I imagine this is adversely affecting my credit report, and it's seriously stressing me out. I believe SallieMae is manipulating the payment period and hiding information in an effort to create a situation that would be impossible to keep my payments current, and I'd definitely be willing to take legal recourse if it's warranted. I wouldn't want anybody else to have to deal with these seemingly unfair practices."
2008-01-04 11:46:51,"Fort Wayne, IN",Curt,,"Needless to say, not everyone is smart when they are in college and even less smart when they are forced to drop out for financial reasons. I had some student loans through Wells Fargo for several years and finally they decided that my inability to pay, etc. was not working out and sold them to Sallie Mae. Eventually I ended up being harassed by a collections agency called Pioneer, who made me a payment offer I could deal with and the loans came out of reparation and were purchased back by Sallie Mae (which of course I had no say in the matter). About 1 week before my payment was due, I received a letter in the mail stating that the information I had provided had been validated and that they had set up automatic payment from my bank account as I had requested. Funny, I never made that request! Nor did I provide them with any information! (I assume they acquired it from Pioneer.) Now it gets fun. Since the Christmas holiday all their offices were closed, I couldn't contact them about this unauthorized payment, nor verify they were drawing from the right account! Sure enough, it came through my BUSINESS ACCOUNT which was at a $0 balance about to be closed out since I kept having stupid things coming through that I had to keep disputing just trying desperately to get this account closed. Needless to say, any attempt to figure out a way around this on their website was impossible because any changes to my billing would have not negated this payment according to their website. Also, once I finally did get in contact with someone after the incorrect account had been drawn, it was some foreign lady that they've obviously outsourced their customer service to, who could only direct me to the website to update my account information. I highly doubt I'll ever find out how they managed to acquire my authorization or the outdated information that they had validated upon my request as I didn't have the heart to try to attempt to file a complaint with some poor lady who barely spoke English. I did file a complaint with the BBB though, and now here. I hope it deters anyone from EVER letting Sallie Mae handle any of your loans.Luckily I was able to settle this without any additional fees from my bank (JP Morgan Chase, whom I am going to attempt to get to purchase these loans out from Sallie Mae). However it gave me tons of headaches and wasted time that could have much better been spent sleeping."
2007-12-26 20:37:44,"Agoura Hills, CA",John,,"I cosigned for a loan for a relative around 2001.  The relative did not pay the loan back on time, so guess who gets the calls?  I asked if there was anything I could do to remove my name from the account.  I was given the amount of $7200 to pay on a full loan amount of approximately $14,000. I sent the money  That was the summer of 2004.  I ran my credit report a couple of months ago and found that negative info was being reported.  Upon calling Sallie Mae, I was informed they had no record of me buying my way out of the loan.  I guess I sent the money out of the kindness of my heart!  I have a letter from them stating what the transaction was about.  Problem is, I've moved twice since this time, and I'm still opening boxes.  Shouldn't they have records of transactions?  They won't even release the name of the person I spoke to. Help."
2007-12-19 13:15:25,"Merritt Island, FL",Monica,,"My college uses Sallie Mae for all financial help, so I signed up with them and got approved. Yay me! They said that I could pay $114 a month, which I thought was kinda high, but worth it. After graduation, the payments DOUBLED. I called them to ask what had happened, and got the run around. I was transferred to at least 3 different people before I finally got someone to explain to me some crack about payment increases. I regretfully paid the hiked fees. A few months later, I moved from Los Angeles to Florida. I called them to let them know that I was in the middle of a move, and that I was unable to make such high payments. I told them that I could only afford about $50 a month. The person on the line said that I should pay what I could pay and that it would be fine. Great! I thought. I made these payments for a few months, before I got my first late notice in the mail. The person on the line had misinformed me. I was told that $50 was fine, and here I see huge late fees being tacked onto my payments! I called back, got the run around (as per usual) and was eventually told that I had to submit a request in writing. I did as they asked, and called back a few weeks later. They didn't know what I was talking about, until I insisted about it enough times. Then I get the oh, that! We denied that because there was already a payment change in September of 05! This was just the beginning of the financial problems. I tried to file for a forbearance, and they said that I had to get caught up. I didn't have the money, but I begrudgingly used my (now) husband's credit card. They never filed my forbearance request. This was one of THREE times that they have done this to me. I've since had a child, and they finally files a forbearance for 6 months. Near the end of this period, I called them to inform them of an address change. The guy answered with The reason I've called you today was to inform you that you're over 60 days late on your payment. I informed him that A) I had called him and B) my next payment was due two months from that day.  He said that he had no record of my forbearance on file (even though I had initially called the automated machine to get the date of my next payment, and that machine had confirmed the date for two months from the day in question). After my baby was born, I had to quit my job. I have to move in with my parents and rely on a single income. The financial hardship is so bad that I have to choose between groceries and Sallie Mae. I've informed them of this hardship and they refuse to offer me any slack whatsoever, and continue to not only attempt to extort money from me, but they harass me on a daily basis. I've had to cancel my land line (for the most part due to harassment, and secondarily due to financial hardship), and they've somehow managed to find my cell phone number and have started to harass me on my cell phone, now! Today alone (so far), they've called me at 8:34, 9:57, 10:08, 10:32, 10:46, 11:08, 11:25 and 12:26 (it's now 1:00PM as I file this), and refuse to stop calling me, as per my request.  When my son goes to college, I would rather sell my own kidneys on the black market (both of them, and DIE because of it!) to help him pay for school than go through Sallie Mae. I would not wish this mental anguish on my worst enemies.I've suffered emotional trauma from this incident. Fear of my own phone. I've unplugged my land line for a period of no less than four months time before cancelling the line completely."

I did not want loans with them, preferring Directnet, but they got me Sallie Mae loans anyhow. I graduated from the art college and enrolled in the local university for further classes. Sallie Mae started sending nasty emails, wanting payments. I have never received a paper bill. I requested paper billing, and they referred me to their website. When I try to log on to my account, it says it is suspended and to call them. When I call them they are abusive and nasty and demand payment. I tell them I am in school and would like a forbearance form sent. I have asked for a form at least six times. They email me a form in PDF format which does not open, it has error messages. I call them back and tell them that their form is not working. I ask for a peper form to be sent. They refuse. They refer me back to the website that I cannot log into, and offer to send me another PDF form which has error messages and will not open. I am now in default, and whenever I call them I get a complete runaround and no answers. They are calling 5 or 6 times a day, every day, and I don't know what to do. I have tried to work with them and it is impossible.I cannot make these payments. I am not working and I am attending school. I have done everything I was told to do to get a deferral or a forbearance, and they have done everything they can to prevent that from happening, purposely putting me in default so they can charge me more and more and more money."
2007-12-13 13:18:19,"Staunton, VA",Mindi,,"Opting to go with a bank I trust, I tried to consolidate my Sallie Mae loans (about $19,000) with Bank of America. I filled out the application in October, a month before my grace period ended and three months before I was to begin repayment. About mid-November I called BOA to find out how my application was going. They told me that they had requested my loan information three times from Sallie Mae, but Sallie Mae would not release it to them. When I called Sallie Mae, they said they would not release my information to BOA because another company had already tried to consolidate my loans. So I called that company who said they knew nothing about it. They didn't even know who I was. So the rep and I did a conference call to Sallie Mae, during which we were bounced back and forth several times and then sent to the overseas office. We were then cut off. Finally, a representative of Sallie Mae agreed to release my information to BOA, as long as they sent another (fourth!) request, which they did. It is now a month later and BOA still does not have my loan information and cannot move forward with consolidation. My repayment begins in 3 weeks and I cannot afford the high monthly payment with Sallie Mae. Every time I call them, I am shuffled around and eventually sent to the overseas department where the operator does not speak English. Nobody seems to have knowledge of what the person ahead of them did, and no one will give me their extension to check back with them (We don't have extensions, they say.) After reading these horror stories, I'm even more terrified to consolidate with Sallie Mae. I have no idea what to do. Is there any legal recourse for this problem? Can they legally just refuse to send my information to the company I want to lend with? "
2007-12-11 23:30:28,"Cortland, OH",G.&amp;,,"I agree with Marge from California! This is nuts. My husband and I went to college when our oldest was in diapers, and we have been paying our Sallie Mae nightmare ever since then. Well she graduates from high school this year, and we owe $3,000 MORE than when we started paying. Just as guaranteed as Sallie Mae's loan is, I GUARANTEE ALL OF MY KIDS WILL NEVER TAKE A PENNY FROM THIS BLOOD COMPANY! They are like the money sharks in the movies; (hypothetically speaking) they charge you double interest and break an arm or a leg if you don't pay on time. They don't care one bit if you are struggling, trying to make payments, or if you are hungry and need to buy food. They don't care just as long as they get their payment that DOESN'T EVEN APPLY TO WHAT YOU OWE! This has economically devastated us and probably will forever, since we can't seem to pay it off. My husband wants to hide out in the hospital with depression because he just can't deal with it."
2007-12-10 14:28:40,"Midvale, UT",Jamie,,"I had to apply for financial aid with University of Phoenix and foolishly signed up to receive loans from SallieMae--a company I have had problems with in the past when they refused a deferment option when I had to leave the country on a mission.After paying off $10,000 loan with SallieMae in September, my wife requested a cancellation of the account and was told I had to do it myself. At the end of November, SallieMae had sent another $10,000 disbursement to University of Phoenix. When I tried telling them I didn't want the loan they told me it was too late and that I owe them the pay-off amount plus interest.  Do consumers not have rights to cancel services after paying off their balance? Now I have to pay SallieMae the loan amount plus interest rather than paying for my school direct."
2007-12-09 03:23:56,"Oceanside, CA",K,,"I started nursing school in June 06 and the company our school preferred was Sallie Mae for all loans. I was excited to get approved for the loan and while I was in school Sallie Mae told me that I could pay $10.00 monthly and this was very exciting because I did not have a job and my husband was the only working person in our home, so that amount we could afford. As soon as I graduated from school the next month, I got a letter from Sallie Mae stating that my next payment is due and the amount was $191.55. The payment jumped $181.55 too much. I immediately called them to ask about this. The rep on the phone gave me the run around. I spoke to 8 people about this and then I requested to speak to a MGR and no one else. I got a MGR on the phone and she told me to fax in a letter stating that I want a change in terms for my loan and put on that fax the exact amount I could pay. I was very satisfied to hear that. 2 wks after faxing the letter, I called to check and see if my terms have been changed and again got the run around with about 5 reps and again I requested to speak with a MGR. I got a MGR for the second time and was then told that my fax request was denied because in June 06 the terms were already changed to $10.00 monthly fees. I told him that I was in school and that was the agreement while in school but now the jump from $10.00 to $191.55 is extremely too high and I do not have a job as of yet and I could not afford that. The responds was could you use one of your credit cards or borrow from friends/family? I said No and what can I do to change the monthly payment because I just cannot pay this amount. He said nothing can be done because the loan I have can only be changed once and it already had been in June 06. I told him I am really trying to keep my credit worthiness with you guys and my personal credit report good but I just can't make that high of a payment. Needless to say nothing was changed and I have been and still continue to make these high payments for the sake of both my husband's and my personal credit history. The only thing that for me has seemed to work out is now I have changed my due date to the end of the month so I can pay all the house bills that are due the first of the month. Never use these people. I am considering taking out a personal loan with my bank to cover this and pay them my intrest rate and the monthly payments will be lower."
2007-12-09 01:10:52,"Dana Point, CA",Kristy,,"The very first letter I received from Sallie Mae about my student loan was a default letter. They NEVER sent me my first bill...now after all payments being made on time in the proper amts, they continue to send me letters threatening collections. They are asking for more and more money each time and not letting me know when it's due. Next thing I know, 2 weeks after making my payment I have another letter from them telling me I have an overdue payment. THIS MAKES NO SENSE. I have spoken to someone on 3 different occasions, and they have been everything BUT helpful. I am confused as to what this company is doing because it feels fraudulent if you ask me. My principal balance has GONE UP...with ALL my payments being made. Now I need to go to my bank to take a loan out so I can get these people paid, so I DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THEM ANYMORE! Please, this situation is out of control, and now my co-signers and my credit hangs in the balance. My anxiety has finally hit the roof....They are obviously not abiding by the repayment terms."

I worked hard at both schools, signing for my own loans and attending classes properly. Well, I had probably signed for over $40,000 in loans somehow because the school would always pressure me to sign. I was almost done with  my bachelors and they requested another loan for that fall. I couldn't get one without a co-signer. Nobody in my family could do that. Just before I was about to call it quits, the National Guard called me into service. I withdrew from school under military conditions.   Apparently because my deferment time ran out, my repayment began. I started getting huge bills from Sallie Mae for over $500+ for loans I didn't even realize I signed for. I had the government ones that remained in deferment. I think they still are right now. I can't go back to school now because of the loans, and I will never be able to finish my degree. So now I'm in a catch22. I can't finish the degree to get a job to pay for these huge loans; therefore I will never be able to pay for them; therefore I can't win, and neither can Sallie Mae. By now they've stated I've defaulted and thrown it into collections."

I graduated from college almost 2 years ago, and it took about 7 months for them to figure out my consolidation--sticking me with the highest interest rate they have. (I'd still like to know how they calculate that.) I have a payment of $664.00 a month, but that wasn't even the problem. The problem is I've paid them now 6 or 7 payments and this last payment I was off by $5. They contacted me; I told the lady that I'd put it on the next payment, and she said &quot;You can do that sir but the computer will keep calling you. It's best to pay it now.&quot; I really didn't want to just out of principle but they also called my co-signers as well. So I paid them. But I continued to get phone calls to pay, even after they said they had it taken care of with their computer calling system and with reminders in their files that I had paid. I got an email the day before from Sallie Mae saying that they already got my payment.  Anyway someone or everyone needs to do something. I mean this is ridiculous; they have called me six times in the last three days for $5. Isn't there something we can do?"

2007-12-01 15:06:57,"Roswell, NM",Nancy,,"I recently graduated from University of Phoenix with a bachelors.  I took two loans out with Sallie Mae, private loans.  My loans entered repayment in October, so in August I began making phone calls to get an in school deferment.  I was sent the form late September, sent the form and my school filled it out and sent on October 3.  They sent in the consortium agreement and both certifications from the school.  Well, once they receive that after 13 faxes from myself and the school.  Oh and each rep kept telling me they would request a deferment on the loans, well one was granted then two months later it was removed.  I talked to a collections rep because my calls were automatically transferred to them because now they were in default.  She told me they would request the deferment be removed because it was a mistake.  Well they got and now I get calls everyday from Sallie Mae, every 20 minutes.  I was finally able to talk to someone that wanted a letter from the school telling them what they considered half time.  So the school has sent it and nothing has changed, just the regular 3-5 business days to process.  I have read your comments and noticed that Sallie Mae will refuse to consolidate loans from other lenders, I was hoping this would relieve me from their nightmare.  I went back to graduate school and am attending more than half time status.  I really hate this company and am early on that I will not request consolidation but rather take out a personal loan to pay them off,  I don't want to go through what the others have gone through.  I really hate that company and have told many of my friends to not even consider applying with Sallie Mae, if students don't to business with them then they will learn to deal fairly. My regret is that the government is backing them up and is legalizing all of the harassment and belittling this company does."
2007-11-28 13:13:03,"Fort Huachuca, AZ",Michael,,"I've been paying off my school loans for the past 9 years.  I had over $10,000 in principal in private loans and $5000 in federal loans from Sallie Mae.  On the federal loans my interest rate has stayed the same, but my private loans were adjustable.  The interest rates would increase and I would receive no notification from Sallie Mae, so my payment amount would jump up, but I would pay the amount from the previous month.  Suddenly, my parents (I'm 30 years old, give me a break) and I would get harassing phone calls talking about how my payments weren't enough and then I was charged numerous late fees.  It got so bad that every quarter it seemed I was getting one of these calls.I finally decided just to pay $100 over the actual due amount to keep this from happening.  I then joined the Army, which has qualified me for the Soldiers and Sailors act.  My private loans now have a fixed 6% rate and I've actually made some progress toward knocking out my principal.  I thought everything was going great, when this past month I made several discoveries.This past month I made my usual payment of $225 (my amount due is $149).  My credit union shows that the payment was made to Sallie Mae, but my Sallie Mae account showed no such payment had been made.  I called Sallie Mae inquiring on my discovery.  The rep I talked to kept me on the line for twenty minutes while he searched my account for the payment.  After this wait he got back on and told me that it is possible that my payment did not have my account information on it, so instead of being put toward my account, it was put in a hold status.  He then told me I needed to fax proof that I made the payment to the company in order for my account to get credit (keep in mind, I've been making payments twelve times a year for nine years.  This had never happened before.)  He then told me that I should see my money put to the account within 3-5 business days (This was without me faxing anything).  I find it very peculiar that my money will just somehow magically appear in 3-5 business days.One other revelation I had with them happened as I was looking at my account payment history.  As I said I pay $225 a month.  My amount due is $108 for my private loans and $41 for my federal loans.  I noticed that they were putting my entire $225 toward the private loans and once every four months they would put some toward the federal loan.  I did the math and in four months the amount of interest that accrues on the federal loan is the amount they were putting toward that loan.  In other words, they let the loan's interest grow until it reaches a certain point and then put my payment toward it (I'm not cutting the principal).When I talked to their reps about this, each one has their own theory on why this happens the way it does.  The truth is, the company will do everything it can to try and keep me in their debt.  I am so very frustrated with this company and would love to get out from under the horror they've created for me.The only physical damage I've seen is my emotional level.  I am a husband and a father and my family never sees me in a good mood because of the stress this company invokes.  Economically there were months (before I joined the Army) when my other bills were late because I spent all my money paying late fees to Sallie Mae.  My credit record and score has been greatly impacted by this."
2007-11-28 08:45:07,"East Rutherford, NJ",Laura,,"I have several signature student (private)loans with Sallie Mae as the provider. I recently put in an application with Sallie Mae to consolidate all of my loans to get a lower interest rate and thus, a lower monthly payment.  When I received a letter stating I was approved with the rate they would offer me,the interest was higher than what I am currently paying them.  I immediately called them to withdraw the loan for that reason.  They have on record that the loan application should have been withdrawn (three dated records of my request before it was processed) and told me they don't know how it was processed when it is clearly indicated that it should be withdrawn.  Needless to say, they went ahead and paid off my loans and consolidated them.  Each time I call them I am told to call back and they cannot or will not help me resolve the problem hoping I will accept the new loan at a higher interest rate and higher monthly payment.  I didn't realize it was legal for them to do this and I did not agree to the terms, nor was I expecting them to process the loan after calling several times BEFORE the consolidation process began.Sallie Mae is now trying to force me into a new loan that I did not agree to that is charging me a higher rate of interest making my monthly minimum payment of about $40 more than what I am currently paying.  I would like to have this resolved, as it is an economic hardship on me as it is without the consolidation.  Prior to consolidation, my minimum payments were $589 per month and I can barely handle that amount."
2007-11-18 22:09:17,"Sacramento, CA",Kate,,"SallieMae has called and mailed me and my mother repeatedly because we were used as a reference by my cousin.  I've told them innumerable times what his up-to-date address and phone number are, but they insist on using my mom's address as his and contacting us again and again.  It's been years now, and I don't know how to get it to stop.  He's not paying his debt, but WE'RE the ones being harassed."
2007-11-14 00:54:55,"Petaluma, CA",J,,"Ahhhh.....Good 'ol Sallie Mae. Where do I begin?I have had this loan since 1998--going on 10 years now. I recently went back to school--grad school--and was told that my school would auto update the clearinghouse with my full-time status. I started to receive phone calls from SallieMae collections after they did not receive their Sept loan payment. I explained the situation to the gentleman and he suggested that I physically get an in-school deferment form filled out and fax it to them. So that is what I did. I continued to receive phone calls from collections, harrassing, rude, unwilling to help. So I decided to actually call SallieMae myself to see what was up with my deferment. I no longer could get through to customer service--I was automatically re-routed to collections EVERY SINGLE TIME!!! Not one of them wanted to help me...they just wanted me to pay. I insisted on speaking to customer service because that was were I sent my form. I had to pretend that I did not have an account with them on the key pad and finally pleaded with customer service not to send me to collections (I was told once that this was a guideline--once in collections, they can no longer help) Anyway...I asked what was going on with my deferment--they looked it up and said that there was a signature missing. No one from SallieMae took the time to inform me that the fax did not go through correctly. It took 2 more weeks of fighting with collections and trying to get through to customer service after faxing and re-faxing to multiple people, before anything was taken care of. I complained to customer service when my account was brought up to date and all I got was I am sorry that this happened to you I explained that it was virtually impossible to get through to customer service to take care of the problem--where the problem originated--and all I get is I am sorry. I was so sick of hearing that. Honestly, it felt so insincere...I have dealt with the evilness of SallieMae before....My co-signer died a few years ago and the insurer, Heymar, called me and told me that the loan was due in full. I told her that there was no way I could pay 20,000 in full so she lied to me and told me that my grandfather's estate was probated. I had to get a lawyer with my grandmother and found out that Heymar/SallieMae could not go after my grandmother for the full amount. Heymar then contacted my uncle, who was a reference on my loan, and asked him what I intended to do with this loan, pay in full or make other arrangements. She wanted to take care of this before she left (she was leaving the company). Is this not against the law? My uncle was only a reference.Every contact that I have with SallieMae is recorded now. I get names (I was refused a few names before, maam we don't give out names here---yeah, well, they introduced themselves at the beginning of the phone call and now they won't give it to me????) So shady (for lack of a better word)"
2007-11-13 00:58:02,"Bloomington, IN",Donna,,"My daughter, her dad and I as co-signers, will never be able to get this private Sallie Mae loan paid off.  It keeps growing.  The 8 calls each day is harassment, as I try to tell them at least once a day, that I have every intention of paying; we just can't.  (They say, borrow the payment from a friend or relative....That would be the most stupid idea ever....)I just want to know what can be done about this? I have asked reps, &quot;Who owns Sallie Mae?&quot;, and NO ONE knows the answer. Someone has to be the top person, somewhere."
2007-11-06 21:43:31,"Kansas City, MO",Christine,,"I was advised by my son's school that Sallie Mae had questions on my parents plus loan.  I called Sallie Mae and was told that the loan that I signed the day before was not approved and wanted to go over my credit.  I never applied for this loan.  I applied for a loan thru Wells Fargo, not Sallie Mae.  I've been having problems with Sallie Mae for a year.  The only reason I chose Sallie Mae in the beginning because it's the preferred lender of the school.  Sometimes, I feel the school and Sallie Mae are trying everything in their power to stop me from going to Wells Fargo.  I am now in the process of consolidating the Sallie Mae loan with Wells Fargo.  Hopefully, this will solve all my problems with Sallie Mae, unless I get another application submitted unknowingly by me. It caused the delay in financing my son's education and a lot of frustration on my part trying to get my parent's loan straightened out."
2007-11-05 19:54:15,"Corona, CA",Marge,,"I have been extremely stressed regarding a supposedly cancelled loan with Sallie Mae which I took out in June. I had enrolled for classes at New Horizons in Orange County, CA and was approved for a tuition loan in the amount of $7274.00. I had cancelled my enrollment from the school who then sent a check back to Sallie Mae less the enrollment fees which I was not aware of. Towards the end of August I began receiving phone calls from Sallie Mae collections saying I am in default. I have not received any other information besides that I signed a contract? and that I have incurred interest? on the loan. Sometime after those harassing calls, I received a call from a Sallie Mae employee who had explained that I now owe more than $400 dollars because of incurred interest as well as penalties. I had agreed to give her payment and gave my credit card number. I proceeded to call the Sallie Mae consumer advocate and spoke to a gentleman named Rich which turned out to be in vain because he has not made any progress and on October 26, Sallie Mae had once again sent a disbursement check to New Horizons. A phone call to New Horizons confirmed that check has been mailed back but now I am once again receiving my regular hourly calls from collections."
2007-09-25 10:55:49,"Oak Lawn, IL",Nina,,"I have been paying on my Sallie Mae account since around the year 200.  It is now 2007 and I have paid them just under $22,000!  Of that, just over $2,000 has been applied to my principal and my balance is around $1000 more than the original cost of my loans!  That's 7 years and I now owe more than when I started!  I am dumbfounded and don't know what to do!  I locked into my rate of 7.625% and now cannot reconsolidate.  It burns me when I get solicitations in the mail to reconsolidate at a lower rate when I am not able to do so without...gee taking out another student loan - which I would assume I no longer qualify for due to my salary.  Nor do I find that a viable option - borrowing more to pay less on more...does that really add up to a savings?  My head hurts and my stomach is sick!  I literally was in tears as I added up the figures above!  There was a spell when I was making double payments and noticed they were all going towards interest.  I questioned Sallie Mae and silly me...apparently you have to MAIL in additional payments with a note EXPLICITLY requesting that the payment be applied to your principal.  No one ever explained THAT part!"
2007-09-14 07:22:15,"East Yaphank, NY",Sean,,"For nearly 8 years I have had to endure a constant battle with Sallie Mae Servicing over unfair practices that have prolonged relatively simple issues in order for the company to gain interest for my student loans which they service. Worse than that, the loans were sold to Sallie Mae without my knowledge. I decided to use an award I received from The Corporation for National &amp; Community Service (AmeriCorps) to pay off my loans in full. I sent in the application, called to confirm receipt and was assured that Sallie Mae would complete the process. The bills continued to come to me. I was again advised to forbear my loans until my award was processed. Nearly 2 years later, interest is still accruing on my account; Sallie Mae has again not completed its obligation. And now the principal on my loans has more than doubled. "
2007-09-05 13:45:52,"Anchorage, AK",Debbie,,"I saved for 6 years to go to law school, attending 1989-1991.  I worked as a prosecutor for 8 years, helping to get drunk drivers and domestic violence assaulters into alcohol and anger management classes.  Helping the community for lower wages, that was me.  I am now on social security disability and cannot work.  Sallie Mae won't help me and can garnish my disability income.  I borrowed $15,000 and after 16 years of responsible paying I still owe $12,000.  It's so stressful!!  My friend racked up $18,000 in credit card debt buying jewelry, clothes and expensive vacations.  She gets to go through bankruptcy and discharge that consumer debt.  If I go through bankruptcy my school loans are not discharged.  The only way for me to get my family out of this burden is to DIE.  It's so unfair that my health problems don't matter a whit to Sallie Mae.  When I signed the loan papers, they were a government-backed entity.  Now they are a for-profit that makes millions of dollars off well-meaning Americans who did nothing more than try to improve themselves and serve their communities.  Bah!I am so stressed out.  The financial hardship makes my health condition worse.  Talk therapy helps somewhat.  What would work better for me would be negotiating constructively with Sallie Mae for a flat pay-out."
2007-09-05 11:40:35,"Antrim, NH",Dale,,"The outstanding balance of my loan, which was in collection was settled and paid off by the closing attorney for my refinance. Sallie Mae SETTLED the outstanding balance with the attorney. Twenty months after I refinanced, they sent the balance (After nearly two months, Sallie Mae has not responded and the AG has given them ten days to respond."
2007-09-05 08:48:01,"Goose Creek, SC",Leslie,,"I called to pay in full via phone one of my student loans. For some reason they have 2 listed for me. One, they won't post payments via phone, only via their website. Secondly, I was given the runaround if it would actually pay in full the said loan segment. Thirdly, I was berated for 5 minutes for even wanting to pay off my loan. As another note, years ago when I consolidated my loans, Sallie Mae was more than happy to move my loan out of a federal funded program at 4% interest into a Sallie Mae loan at a much higher interest rate. Now they refuse to move it back. There was NO disclosure of the fact that the consolidation would be higher rate.When I requested to be transferred to the specific payment department I was told that that department does not exist. I did not feel comfortable speaking with the offshore person as it was obvious he was reading from a script. There should be a way to speak with a specialist that resides in the home office when requested.After reading all the complaints against Sallie Mae, I have zero trust that they will in fact post my payment properly. Costing me time and effort to get things done correctly."
2007-07-24 11:17:59,"Tallahassee, FL",Steve,,I contacted Sally Mae online to get info on a student loan. I got a call from them that my credit was not good enough for a loan and would need a cosigner. I told them I wasn't interested. I now can't get them to stop contacting me. They email with bogus web form addresses and call as much as 3 times a day.
2007-07-23 10:24:32,"Racine, WI",Mary,,"First, it is my daughter's fault that she kept borrowing on her Sallie Mae loan; but I believe she did so with the thought that it would be at a low interest rate as was her original school loan.   Now she is strapped with $80,000+ in debt, and each payment applies approximately $3.00 toward the principal; which will never clear it.  She has tried to get them to reduce the interest; but they aren't concerned.  Such a shame.  Just 27 years old, just married and possibility of losing all she has worked for so far."
2007-05-08 13:02:36,"Baltimore, MD",Christopher,,"I took out a Sallie Mae loan in the amount of $3495 to attend TESST university. I am in the military and was able to garner $2133 in tuition assistance from the army. After providing TESST with the tuition assistance, they cut a check to Sallie Mae which was supposed to be deducted from my principle amount. This check was cashed by Sallie Mae in March of 06' however the amount was never deducted from my principle. I faxed a copy of the cancelled check to Sallie Mae 4 times. The amount has still not been deducted. Every time I call to confirm reciept of the fax, the customer service representative says that I should fax it to a different number. The 3rd time it supposedly showed up on my account and I was fortunate enough to get a POC with whome I could work with. When my account was not credited in the time that they said it would be, I called my POC using the pin-number I was provided. Lucky for me though, the pin number had expired and nobody was willing to patch me through to the woman who was working with me.  To this day, more than a year later, my account has not been credited and I don't think it ever will be even though I have proof that Sallie Mae took the money."

Apparently, I made the mistake of paying early on a monthly $10.00 agreement and was told that because I did this the interest started early at initially 17% then has now raised to over 18%. I have asked at least 4 supervisors for clarification on this as well as how they were calculating interest on my son's loan. To date no one can tell me and no one will provide me with the information. I have recently asked for a pay off statement on 29 April which they said would be good for 10 days...I have yet to recieve the statement its now 4 May. They told me the figure and said I could pay it over the phone but would not explain how after borrowing $11K his interest was over $4k in less than 24 months from origination. I was just told that I could go to their web site and get this information but after doing so could not get on the site. They have threatened to send a report to the credit agencies which will obviously be adverse but will not give me the proper infromation to pay off the loan."

I was very excited and was planning on paying more than $10 so that my credit would be good. I was not told by anyone that after 6 months it would change to just over $100.00 a month and the interest rate is 18%. I have tried to call and get help from both my school and from Sallie Mae but to no avail.

None, nada, zip, zilch. I do have emails though Thank you fopr registering You need to do...blah, blah (Which I did)I was quoted an interest rate of somewhere between 6.2 and 8% - so this will cost me MANY THOUSANDS of dollars.

2007-04-17 20:58:04,"Grapevine, TX",Samuel,,"I have a student loan with Sallie Mae and I opted for online billing when I started taking a continuing education class. That was my mistake. I spoke with customer service to try to get a paper bill in the mail instead of online billing. I was told that the only way to change my billing option was using their website. I was unable to ever get a paper bill sent to me. My account became 37 days delinquent and that's when I started getting phone calls 3 times a day on both my home and cell phone. I spoke with a collection specialist to see if I could get a bill mailed to me. James at extention 3260 told me that I had to pay my bill by phone using check or credit card immediatly and that if my account reached 45 days of delinquency that my credit would be affected. I told him that I did not feel comfortable making my payment by phone and that I have requested to be billed by mail on multiple occasions. He again directed me to their website. I told him that I had tried that unsucessfully. He told me that there was no way I could get anything mailed to me and that I had to pay by phone right now. After convincing him that I could not pay by phone he finally gave me an address that I could send a payment to, then he hung up on me!"

They would not give me the name of an individual to which I could speak to get to the bottom of the issue.As you can imagine this was frustrating. At the end of the month Sallie Mae debited my checking account for the minimum payment--now this is the annoying part--I prepaid my account to something like 2012! I contacted them about this problem only to be given the same canned response. Since I expected this to happen again and  as I could not contact anyone who would be willing to give me an answer I kept the minimum payment amount in my account--mind you on most months I paid several times the minimum. They continued to debit my account for the minimum, even though their site said the next payment was due in several years.Again, I tried to get someone's name to resolve this issue, and yet again I was given a canned answer. I asked for the name of the organization who regulated them and was given no answer.I finally became so frustrated that I paid off the loan in full.There has to be some kind of recourse one can take against this kind of business practice."
2007-04-11 19:35:04,"Fullerton, CA",Julian,,"In June of 2005, I attempted to consolidate my undergraduate loans ($16,000) and first year law school loans ($18,000) at the historic low 2.8% interest.  At the time, my loans were with Sallie Mae.  I attempted to consolidate these loans through a different student loan company, unaware that Sallie Mae was refusing to accept consolidation payments from other companies. A week or so after my consolidation application was submitted, I was contacted by the company and told that Sallie Mae had prohibited them from consolidatin my loan.  Consequentially, I was unable to consolidate with Sallie Mae before the July 1, 2005 deadline.  I consolidated the loans, along with my 2L law school loans, in June 2006 at 4.7%.  Over the life of the loans, I will end up paying thousands of dollars in additional interest.  Sallie Mae is responsible for this, unless what it did was legal.  If so, then the other company is responsible for this, because it should have known that it could not consolidate my loan, and that attempting to do so in late June would leave me unable to consolidate before the July 1, 2005 deadline.I have the June 2005 consolidation application at home, which has all the information of the company I attempted to consolidate with.  Approximately $35,000 of my loans were consolidated at 4.7%, when they would have been consolidated at 2.8%.  The net damage to me will be thousands of dollars in additional interest, compounded."

I need help at this point to figure out how much my kids and I actually owe them.  In todays mail my son got a notice from an attorney saying he was in default on his loans and they are charging him $1600 in collection fees on top of loans and interest.  We are getting buried by this group.  Never talk to the same person twice, no one there knows of the payment agreement I made years ago, and the debt is now over $120,000.

2007-04-05 16:42:51,"Saint Paul, MN",Sam,,"Sallie Mae is the most difficult company I have ever worked with, when I call them I just get transferd around, and usually don't have the time to waste on the phone, and when I email them I get very vague answers, and they have never been helpful, their customer service is a joke. First May payments started in Feb 2007 and on my first bill I had a late fee of $25 for a payment that was not even due, I tried to question them on this, and I could not get an answer, then on my March bill I had two late fees, one for my late Feb payment and one for a March payment that was not due yet, I got tired of trying to find out where these late fees were comeing from and paid my Feb and March payments, and in the meantime my monthly payment went up $20 dollars, I have no idea where that came from.Second complaint, I was applying for a consolodation loan, and I had a question about their application on thier website, there is a question that confirms the last school I atteded, and it was wrong from, and they didn't have my school in the list, so I sent them an email on how to fix this, and they replied that I needed to check the website for the answer, I replied to them that I couldn't find it on the website, and they replied back to me, thanks for using sallie mae.Third complaint, I have three loans with them and two of them they bought from another company, without my knowlege or consent, (I guess they do that all the time with would explain why they don't care about their customers) I don't think they should be allowed to do that, I don't want anything to do with sallie mae. Fourth complaint, one of my loans is for a school that went bankrupt and closed when I was about half way through it, and I never got any money back, I was not able to get a job for what i was going to school for, even though I aced every class, I had nothing to show for it, I was not able to use any of the schools resources to help me, the main reason I went there was because they talked so highly about job placement, and I didn't have that opportunity. I think that's about it. Thanks, Sam DavisI have ended up oweing a lot more money, than I think I should, I have fees, that I don't know where they come from, and I can't get any answers from sallie Mae."
2007-04-04 12:09:30,"Nutley, NJ",Margaret,,"I have called Sallie Mae four times to get a question answered to no avail. Their website states that if you set up your account for automatic deduction, you will receive a 0.25% reduction of your interest rate. No where does the material state that this is dependent upon approval from your original lender. Apparently there is something special about my loan that does not allow me to get this discount, however no one can explain what this is. I have spoken to three different reps and one manager, all of whom were completely useless. The rep I spoke to on 3/26/07 had me on told for at least 30 minutes then stated that he resolved the issue, the discount was going to be applied (he acquired an authorization number for it) and that I would get a letter from them in 5-7 business days. Needless to say, this didn't happen.I called back on 4/3/07 and there was no record that this conversation even took place. I finally spoke to a manager, Sharon, who was even more useless than the low level reps. Her explanation is that my previous lender did not authorize the discount. When I pressed her for an answer as to why my previous lender has any say in the scenario being that my loan is with Sallie Mae and this is a Sallie Mae promotion, she had no response. After a month of getting the run around, I am finally fed up. Is it too much to ask to actually speak to someone that understands his business and that speaks English clearly? I am doing whatever I can to get my loan over to another company."
2007-03-27 16:53:42,"Hialeah, FL",Jason,,"I have been trying for over 7 days to get a forebearance and deferrment letter from Sallie Mae in order to close on a mortgage. I explained to the agent that the forebearance letter stated if I qualify and this reflected negatively on me to the Mortgage Lender. I requested a letter that just stated the length of forbearance and deferrments available to me. I was promised this letter within 48 hours. Seven days have since passed with repated attempts from myself and the mortgage company to get this letter and nothing has happened. I called today and advised the agent that I am incurring a $20.00 per day fee to hold my interest rate pending closing. She promised me the letter the same day as a priority.As the end of the day approached nothing happened so I called again. This time I was told that it was not possible. I explained to the Customer Service Manager Michael High, that I was told that the letter would be snt seven days ago and again promised the letter later in the day in question. The manager said that he could not help me, and became very rude and annoyed when I asked for someone who can. He refused to give me the name of his manager, he refused to give me the number for the Corporate Office and he refused to identify his location so that I could file a complaint.Meanwhile, I am in the same predicament, paying $20 a day to hold my interesrt rate while Sallie Mae tells me it will take five more business days, makking it a total of 12 days to get a letter that can be typed and faxed in minutes."

I attempt to communicate with collections to resolve this $14 debt. I make 3 payments, and now am 2 months ahead. Yet I receive collection calls 8 times each day. My cosigner receives at least 6 each day. Collections speaks to us without providing a name or any info, and now is speaking directly to anyone who answers the phone, without asking if it is me or my cosigner. This is illegal. This is harrassment."
2007-02-19 15:51:19,"Denton, TX",Crystal,,"I have been dealing with Sallie Mae for over 7 years now.  I was an undergraduate for 6 years trying to finish my degree, which I finally received last year.  Some would say that's exciting, but because of Sallie Mae, it's been a complete nightmare!!!  I had dealt with their CSR's in the past with no problems, but suddenly now that it's time to start talking repayment I can't find ONE English speaking person at their call center!  Because I wasn't able to find a job to pay my very high monthly payment, I was hoping they would actually work with me, but it's been the complete opposite.  I've had to put my loans in forbearance twice now and that process alone takes about 4 to 5 calls to 3 different places.  At one point, I was dealing with three people, one at the Servicing Center, and two in the forbearance office each of whom sent me different forbearance forms through email, not to mention that they were very generic documents.  One of them didn't even have Sallie Mae anywhere on it!!!  It's as though their offices have no communication between them whatsoever.  You call one person, and they give you one option, but when they transfer you to someone else, somehow that offer is no longer available.  And trying to get Economic Hardship...forget it.  I only make about $1300 a month, yet they actually expect me to make a $500 good faith payment in addition to the $150 dollar fee.  If I had that kind of money, don't you think I would be making my payments as scheduled!  There has not been one person who has adequately answered any of my concerns regarding this issue, and I am beyond PO'd. I will never understand what happened to Sallie Mae's customer service or how it could have changed so drastically between 1999 and today.  My major complaint is their non-English speaking reps who don't understand your questions half the time, and then end up transferring you to someone who has no clue why you were referred to them.  I'm glad I'm not the only one who's having to deal with this mess, and I'm really sorry I ever agreed to any of Sallie Mae's services.  I've already requested the contact information for corporate offices, but who knows if anyone will actually provide me with that information.  If anyone else has corporate information, please post it.  I scoured the site for actual contact info, but not surprisingly it's not available."
2007-01-11 21:37:24,"Liberty, MO",Nikki,,Sallie Mae purchased my loan from EdAmerica and illegally placed my loan in default. I was attending college at the time. They used Pioneer Collection Agency to harrass me every evening. I even faxed them my forbearance from my previous lender and my college schedule. They just laughed at me and even broke the The Privacy Act Of 1974 by express mailing me another students personel loan information. i still have this persons information and I wonder what happen to mine. I did see some strange activities on my credit report shortly after this event that I had deleted.  I did not believe them until they reported this illegal default to all three credit bureaus.This caused me to have a nervous breakdown. I did not finish school. I cannot get decent rates on cars and forget buying a house. They caused me so much economic hardship that all my loans went in default because of them. I feel so used and there collection agency is rude and disrespectful. I still have the documents from all my claims. If someone can help me to fight them. I would appreciate it. I have all my evidence locked in a vault.  They caused me alot of mental and financial hardship. I was going to school and was doing fine until they purchase my loan from EdAmerica. I never had any of my loans go into default. I was very responsible with my loan until they took what life I had away from me. I did report them to my local State Attorneys Office last week.
2007-01-01 21:45:54,"Eagle Rock, CA",Faith,,"I took out a student loan for $9000. Because a payment did not reach them so they said on time my loan was sold to another company which is owned by Sallie Mae. They increased the amount of the loan to $12,000. A few years later I was able to transfer part of the loan onto a credit card and paid off the original $9000. Since that time the company has been sending a bill each month saying that I don't owe a payment until 2007. I recently received a payment book and have found out that I now owe over $1000 in accrued interest and that they are charging me payments and interest over 9 years at a cost of over $16,000 to pay off $3000. I think that is criminal."

2006-09-13 22:44:51,"Leesburg, FL",Robert,,"In 2002 I began attending online college working on a bachelor degree. I already had an AS degree and had hopes of complimenting that with a major in business adminstration. However, after only 9 months of the estimated 2 years it would take to graduate I was unable to attend that college because my student loan application was turned down. I reenrolled in another college as well and my student loan application was denied again. I was applying for a Federal Stafford Loan all of the time. Now, I am continually receiving letters from Sallie Mae and their bill collectors to pay for all loans. The college I attended was not an accredited institution and now I have 9 months of classes that I cannot transfer to other colleges, I have a partial education that is of no use to me and I am continually being threatened that my wages will be garnished.

2006-08-04 13:04:55,"Parma, OH",Kelley,,"Like so many, I have a loan through Sallie Mae.  It has been one Heck of a nightmare!  My loan started out at 64,000 for two degrees.  Now, I show I have to pay over 80,000 dollars. I can't understand their new math.  I tried calling their bogus customer service line only to be read a script or put on hold for over 30 mins.  When I finally got thru to someone who spoke english in the States they were not happy they had to call me.  I look at my loans and see that at one time (in the beginning) they applied my payments to both the interest and principal. Then I see what looks like a subtracted payment from the interest and it is added onto the principal. What is that? After a year or two, they stopped applying my payments to principal and only the interest.  I can't seem to understand how is this possible. If the interest is driven by the principal why not pay it?!?!? Since I couldn't get answers from them, I told them that I was going to have another education loan company take over.  I applied and the company told me that they have  had problems with Sallie Mae. Either they refuse to hand over the loans or they ignore the requests. If the loan is going to be paid off by a government endorsed loan company why won't Sallie Mae take it?  Then I watched 60 Minutes. They did a  report on Sallie Mae. And it dawned on me -- Sallie Mae gets paid regardless, if someone defaults on a loan the government pays it. And who pays in the end? We who pay our bills.  They get paid more money from those who pay.  I need someone's help. HOw do I get out of business with Sallie Mae?  How can I get them to tell me how their math works?  How can I get them to explain to me why they keep trying to have me pay over 400.00 in monthly payments?  Clearly any answers will not be found through their customer service! I am mainly upset and trying not to default on this loan.  I am taking economic hardship."
2006-08-03 10:58:42,"Columbus, OH",Anne,,"I signed up for ComputerTraining.com and agreed to a Sallie Mae student loan. Unfortunately I didn't pay attention to the type of loan and variable interest. I made a huge mistake. The sales rep for ComputerTraining and the Sallie Mae application both stated student loan but the loan was in fact a private loan, as I later found out.  My loan started at 10.00% with a principle balance of $25,000. I was sent a letter a couple of weeks ago stating the interest went up to 11.75%. Two weeks later I went to the web site to check my loan status and payoff amount and the interest was at 12%. My total 15 year term went from 41K to 50K within a year!   Everything about the initial process revolved around the English lanugage.  After the fact though, I can't seem to talk to anyone who speaks fluent english.I was in so much debt before I knew it now I am not sure if I will ever be able to pay it off.  I can't afford anything.  You can't find a high enough paying job at my age of 21 to pay this loan of fast enough.  It's like im paying for a house not an education.  At this rate I won't ever be able to afford a house or a family.  I wish someone would have warned me ahead of time.  I would have choosen not to get an education."

2006-06-12 17:26:07,"Stockton, CA",Damali,,"I started culinary school at the Orlando Culinary Academy about 2 years ago.  I had just been married, was working full time and had 2 children to take care of.  To go to school, I had to go at night.  I intended to start in July of that year, but since my financial package was approved my admissions person suggested I start in May.  Anxious, I decided to start early.  I was doing well in school, on the honour roll and enjoying it, however, my work performance dropped and my marriage suffered.  Within two months everything changed.  My husband left me and my job decided to revert to my normal hours which would prevent me from continuing.  When I realized I would have to leave school I went to the relevant person at school and told them I had to withdraw because of family reasons, I was feeling way too low to explain everything but had no idea I would be trapped with a such a huge debt.  While my loans at 2% (federal) were all sent back, my loans through Sallie Mae at 14% were retained.  I could not understand how I would be stuck with loans for an entire semester, when I had barely completed a quarter.  Now I owe them over $23,000 and it is mounting and I have no idea how I am going to pay.  I am back in school full time, however, everytime I turn around there is a representative from Sallie Mae on the phone.  I feel like the world is closing in on me and I have no recourse.  I pray I do have some recourse and someone can give me advice.The consequences have been severe to my credit, my financial standing and future, I am considering bankruptcy but not sure how that will help.  I need to find out if there is a way to work on this issue, yet I feel completely trapped."
2006-05-18 11:44:14,"Newton, NC",Spencer,,"I recieved a student loan for continuing education and with in one month the school closed and I recieved no services. Sally Mae paid the school and continues to bill me after numeruos timews that I have contacted them about this. After I have done some investigation it seems that this has happened before with Sallie Mae. This has ruined my credit and I can not seem to get any satisfaction .My credit is ruined, I cannot further my education which impacts my economic capabilities."
2006-02-26 17:19:17,"Hibbing, MN",Cher,,"I have been a customer of Sallie Mae Financial for about 3 years, and have had numerous problems trying to get help with my school loan payments. They call you from a number that is only a number that can be called out, not called into and have fictious names of certain customer service employees that claim &quot;we want to help you.&quot; I have asked these people to either email me or send me an application for help with my payments which I never received. They explain to me that it will take 7-14 business days for it to get by mail which come, and in addition, my interest seems to magically increase and my payoff grows larger and larger. I tried to call the customer service number to speak with a manager; I got put on hold for 15 minutes. Also, I have tried to call during the evening hours within the time frame they give you, waiting for 70 minutes for someone to pick up, which no one ever does. My husband has also tried to do this as well and gets the same thing. This never seems to end. On another note, I have asked repeatedly for a &quot;customer service&quot; person to send me something that explains in detail how my loan works, what is being applied towards interest, etc. Nothing was ever sent. My husband was also involved in this as well to maybe help with a different approach; nothing was ever resolved."
2006-01-02 04:42:48,"Los Angeles, CA",Paul,,"We had our house refinanced to specifically pay off my student loans.I called Sallie Mae on December 9,2005 to ask how much the pay-off amount is for my student loans and I was told that the 10-day pay-ff amount was $51,204.28. We sent them a check for $51,300. That amount was debited from our account on the 19th but my Sallie Mae account still showed that I owe $14.24. When I called again, I was told that interest accrued during the period that they did not receive my payment. But I told the Rep that I met the 10-day off, the Rep said that's how its calculated. The Rep said that as long as the company gets my payment before January 7, it will be considered paid-off.So, I paid it again. This time, I tried to do it on-line.  I tried to pay more to cover myself but the system kicked me out and said that it will only accept a 5-day pay-off amount, which was $14.28. Sallie Mae got my money on the 30th. Guess what? I still owe them a dollar. I know its just a dollar, but when will it end? Is it not true that this 10-day pay-off that they advertise on their phone messages and on their website a form of false advertisement?I want my change from the $51,300 and the $14.28 that I paid. I realize now that I did my part: my wife and I refinanced our house to pay off my student loans and we paid more than what the stated pay-off amount was and ended up still owing Sallie Mae. It is Sallie Mae's turn to do its part. We are doing our best to start 2006 debt-free. This is very aggravating. I'm finding it hard to sleep and this whole thing is giving me a headache. Please do something. Thank you so much, have a nice day and a very happy new year to you all."
2005-10-19 12:24:55,"Iowa City, IA",Joseph,,My student loan interest is now 13%.  Which is crazy due to the current interest rate.  I got this loan on line and had no idea it was that high.  When trying to reduce it or have a co-signer I am told the only thing I can do is pay it off.  How can a student loan have that high of interest rate? Does anyone know how I can get this rate lowered.  Is there not a cap on interest rates for students.  I just finished four years at Columbia College Chicago. I don't want this to happen to another student.  13% is almost criminal!!!

2005-05-12 15:31:36,"Deerfield, FL",Brenda,,"1. Delay in posting payments in 2003, then incorrectly reporting that 60 day delay as derogatory on our credit (they denied the delay, but we have the check stubs to prove it). We discovered this when we were trying to do a re-finance in 2004 while interest rates were at their lowest. Sallie Mae deleted these reportings from our credit after a battle, but because of their mistake, it ended up costing us 10,000 in additional interest due to the higher rate we received because of that mistake. We never received interest for those delayed postings from Sallie Mae! 2. At this time we noticed from our payment history that Sallie Mae did not put ANY money towards the principle amount of the loan for approx. 18 months. They just recently started putting some money towards our principle (the last 2 months, nothing has gone to the principle again). Prior to 18 months ago, before Sallie Mae took over our loan, it was SLM, SLM applied money towards our principle every month until SLM took over!. 3. In 2000, our balance was 9000, today it is $8100 - and we've paid out about $ 5000.00-6000.00 4. We've threatened to go to a lawyer and they sent a letter telling us that they would give us $ 700.00 if we sign a release! ?? We did not sign it because we feel that Sallie Mae is doing things incorrectly and owes us settlement.  *I've called several lawyers in the phone book, but only found one that does this kind of work and he said that he's so overwhelmed with cases that he doesn't have time to look at it. Anyone out there interested? I feel that this company is in properly applying payments and more students may be unaware of what is going on.Cost us $ 10,000 in additional interest fees, our balance still isn't going down no matter how much extra we pay each month and it's caused us a lot of stress."
2005-03-28 15:23:13,"Winamac, IN",Mickael,,"I took out a student loan with Sallie Mae. Then I had to file bankrupate. My Lawyer said he filed against Sallie Mae and my loan was cleared. So I didn't make any more payment to Sallie Mae. And I didn't heard anything from them that I was late or behind on my payments. Then around 7 years later I get a letter from them that I still owed them for the stundent loan. I owed them $15,000.00, but now I owed them $30,000.00. I just don't understand why they let the payment go for so long. They never sent me a notice that I was late or behind then one day they dediced to let me know I still owed them.I just don't think it is fair that they can do this and get away with it. I don't mind paying the $15,000.00 that I do owe but not the $30,000.00 they say I owe now. This has cause a hardship on me.Please help me out. Thank you.This has cause a hardship on my life. I am so far in dept any way and then making me pay back more which makes my payments higher is very hard on me. I am working two jobs and it is still hard keeping my head above water."
2005-03-22 12:57:53,"Saraland, AL",Carla,,"I called on Jan. 18, 2005 to have my student loans put into forebearance. At the time the woman told me all my loans were in forebearance and I would not have to worry about them until August of 2005, so therefore I have not. Then I receive a letter from a collection agency stating I owe money for a loan. I called this morning and spoke to Susan and Roger of Sallie Mae to ask them why I was not told I was ineligable for a forebearance when I called on Jan.18 and he said, You should know what you are eligable for and not. I told him that was their job to inform me of that. He disagreed. I then stated that I would send him some money, since I do not have much and he said even if I paid for my loan it will still default. It was not disclosed to me that this loan was not eligable for forebearance or deferment. This is only one of many encounters with Sallie mae and I have proof of many other encounters. I called the collection agency and disputed the bill as being legal and valid.I have already been hospitalized for stress related to the incompetence of Sallie Mae. Mental and physical anguish and monetary damages have accrued due to Sallie Mae's inability to keep loans organized and keep their clients abreast of what is occuring. I had a witness on the phone with me who witnessed Roger's inability and refusal to help me and lack of professionalism. Due to my mental health, I have to ask people to repeat what they say sometimes to retain it and when I asked him to repeat an answer to a question he said, Oh you were not paying attention to me were you. Well, listen this time. It was unbelievable. That is a bit disturbing you know that this man would say such a thing to a handicapped woman. It is horrifying."
2005-01-03 18:21:48,"Madison, WI",Bradley,,"I recently (12/7/04) called Sallie Mae to see if I could have my automatic debit turned off for the month of December because we were already paid ahead 2 months and their automatic debit does not look at due dates.  The representative I spoke to said that that was no problem, and suggested forebearance was the easiest way to have that done for our next payment due December 25th.  Trusting that the Sallie Mae representative knew what they were doing, I agreed to the forebearance.  On December 26th or 27th, my wife noticed that our checking account was overdrafted and we were charged a $10.00 service fee for our checking accounts overdraft protection which then drew from our savings to cover the payment.  On January 3rd I contacted Sallie Mae to find out why they had initiated the payment I had requested they not initiate.  I was informed that the forebearance was not processed in time to stop the payment initiating from my checking account (18 days isn't enough?).  The representative I spoke with apologized for the error and forwarded me to a supervisor to see if there wasn't something they could do for me.  After explaining everything again to the supervisor, the supervisor apologized for the employee error and informed me there was nothing that could be done.  I asked about the $10.00 overdraft fee I was charged as a result of the error, and again the supervisor apologized and said there was nothing that could be done.  I informed the supervisor that I would be moving my consolidated student loans back to the Department of Education and filing a complaint, but all she could say yet again was sorry.  It seems that Sallie Mae should have at least taken responsibility for the error that they admit happened and reversed the transaction and if necessary reimbursed the $10.00 overdraft fee.Overdraft of our account resulting in $10 service fee."

2004-04-07 15:23:21,"Closter, NJ",Vladimir,,"I've been paying off my educational loans to Sallie Mae. In March I received a letter from them stating 'our billing error caused your scheduled payment amount to be too little in order for your account to be satisfied within the loan terms provided. As a result, your monthly payments will increase by $182.19'. It's a 30% increase!!! I always paid accurately the amount Sallie Mae calculated. How did that happen? When I called to find out the details they told me they would send a letter in 2-3 weeks meanwhile I have to pay new amount or take a temporary forbearance. I paid them old amount in March, one month passed I didn't receive anything.  What concerns me the most is how can I trust that they calculated it right this time. How can they increase my payments 30%? And how come they know how much to charge but don't know where and how the error initiated. Can they do it?"
2003-07-02 12:35:25,"Woodmere, NY",Patricia,,My fiancee has a loan with Sallie Mae I am the co-borrower as I pay the bills. Sallie Mae has never sent me the right invoices. When they do send me invoices I am always told I am past due and that I have to pay immediately or actions will be taken against me. When they send a bill I always pay the amount they ask for and I am never late. I just received a bill and I sent the amount on the invoice. I also called them to tell them I am not disputing what we owe I am disputing their invoices. The representative hung up on me because I told them I want the correct invoices sent to me and that I think this is just another way for them to make more money. I also said I think their company is a sham! I am sure next month the same thing will happen. I am getting calls all hours of the day asking me to call about my options of payment. They want to take the monies out of my checking account which I will not permit! I have also written a letter with retrun receipt requested. I am copying all the invoices they send and keeping them for my records. I live on a fixed income and trying to make ends meet every month  all my bills are always paid on time and I have an excellent credit rating and for Sallie Mae to send me threatening letters and phone calls it is absolutely unfounded!I am upset that I am getting called all hours of the day. My pressure goes up everytime I try to rectify this situation.
